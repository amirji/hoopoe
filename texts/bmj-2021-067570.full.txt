Evaluating covid-19 vaccine efficacy and safety in the
post-authorisation phase
When covid-19 vaccines were first authorised, regulators required post-authorisation studies to
tackle important uncertainties about efficacy and safety. But these studies may have little practical
value unless there is greater engagement and scrutiny from the wider scientific community, argue

Expedited approval pathways have been increasingly
used over the past 30 years to bring new medicines
to market. The basic premise has been to give patients
earlier access to medicines, often achieved by relying
on less robust forms of evidence at the time of
approval, such as showing efficacy against surrogate
endpoints rather than patient outcomes.1
Expedited approvals are often coupled with
requirements to conduct post-authorisation studies
to confirm that the medicines safely provide the
anticipated benefit. But a long history of concerns
has emerged about the wisdom of shifting clinically
importantefficacyandsafetyassessmentsfrombefore
to after authorisation.1 -4 Post-authorisation studies
often fail to deliver—lots of studies are never started,
many take years longer than planned, and some fail
to confirm pre-authorisation results. Evidence on
relevant outcomes often remains inconclusive for
several years,5-7 and post-authorisation safety events
are seen more frequently for drugs with expedited
approval.8 Regulatorsonlyrarelysanctioncompanies
for not adhering to post-authorisation study
requirements, and drugs are only rarely withdrawn.2
Covid-19 vaccines are the most recent and prominent
example of expedited regulatory approval. Here, we
discuss the need to strengthen the design, conduct,
reporting, and dissemination of post-authorisation
studies, using covid-19 vaccines as a case study. We
take a close look at improving the transparency
landscape for post-authorisation studies required by
the European Medicines Agency (EMA), focusing on
21 such studies for two mRNA vaccines, and argue
that the appraisal of these studies should not be left
to regulators alone. With active engagement of the
wider scientific community, post-authorisation
studies might finally deliver on their promise of
providing answers to important questions in a timely
fashion.
Limited evidence at time of conditional
approval
The EMA granted conditional marketing
authorisations for four covid-19 vaccines following
theresultsofinterimanalysesofphaseIIIrandomised
controlled trials. The European Union authorisations
for the vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna,
AstraZeneca, and Janssen are “conditional,”
reflecting that, at the time of authorisation, less
evidence than traditionally required for full approval
was available on their safety and efficacy.9 -12
At the two month mark, when the trials were
assessed, manufacturers reported high efficacy
relative to controls against laboratory confirmed
covid-19 (of essentially any severity), but important
unknowns remained. These included efficacy against
SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as severe covid-19 and
the durability of efficacy after two years (the planned
duration of the Pfizer-BioNTech pivotal trial
(NCT04368728)).13 -16
The US Food and Drug Administration listed
important remaining unknowns in its review in
December 2020: whether covid-19 vaccines reduce
the risk of hospital admission, intensive care unit
admission, severe covid-19, and mortality, as well as
whether the vaccines are effective in populations at
high risk of severe covid-19.17 18 Groups of particular
interest, such as older, chronically ill, or
immunocompromised people, were
under-represented in or excluded from trials.19 -21
Ongoing transmission in countries with high levels
ofvaccinationhighlightstheimportanceofcontinued
assessment of real world effectiveness.
Safety data on uncommon adverse events, as well as
medium or long term harms of any frequency, were
necessarily limited at the time of mass vaccine rollout,
leaving some of the most important questions about
efficacy and safety to the post-authorisation phase.
Since authorisation and vaccine rollout, numerous
studies have been published reporting high vaccine
effectiveness at the population level and among
particular groups such as healthcare workers and
elderly people.22 -27. But many of these studies have
important limitations including lack of data on
hospitaladmissions,death,andhighriskpopulations
such as nursing home residents and people with
comorbidities. Perhaps, more importantly, these
studies were conducted outside of the regulatory
framework—while they can be relevant they do not
answer specific questions asked by regulators and
might have limited influence on regulatory decisions.
Post-authorisation studies
After conditional marketing authorisation by the
EMA, vaccine manufacturers Pfizer-BioNTech and
Moderna agreed to carry out 13 and 8
post-authorisation studies, respectively,2829 to assess
important unknowns including: risk of vaccine
associated enhanced disease28 29; effects in pregnant
and breastfeeding women, people who were
immunocompromised, frail, or with comorbidities or

between different vaccines; and to provide long term safety data.
Conditional authorisation ensures that all post-authorisation
obligations are legally binding and evaluated by the EMA. The
requirements are codified in risk management plans written by the
manufacturer and agreed by the regulator before authorisation.
They are “an enforceable feature of the authorisation.”30 Risk
management plans are publicly available documents detailing all
planned and ongoing post-authorisation studies mandated by the
EMA(seesupplementaryboxonbmj.com).Thesepost-authorisation
(phase IV) studies contribute to the EU’s pharmacovigilance system
alongside the more familiar spontaneous adverse event reporting
schemes, EudraVigilance and the UK regulator’s Yellow Card
Scheme.
Although the drug industry is officially responsible for conducting
post-authorisation studies and meeting agreed deadlines for
milestones (such as protocol development and study completion),
the actual work of designing, conducting, and reporting these
important studies can be done by various non-industry actors, such
as academic institutions. The EMA also commissions academic and
private sector partners to conduct some post-authorisation studies
through the ACCESS (vaccine covid-19 monitoring readiness)
project.31
Independent scrutiny
We think that researchers should be involved in both the planning
and appraisal of post-authorisation studies. Independent scrutiny
of regulator sanctioned studies can help close knowledge gaps on
the efficacy and safety of medicines authorised through expedited
pathways, by ensuring the right questions are asked and answered
in a timely manner. Extra scrutiny would help improve the
historically poor track record of required post-authorisation studies.
Independent researchers can ensure transparency, evaluate study
methods, monitor progress, and appraise results (box 1).
Box 1: Practical ways in which researchers can get involved in the
appraisal of post-authorisation studies
• Ensuring transparency—Study documents, including the study
protocol and interim or final clinical study reports, should be available
in registration databases, such as the EU electronic register of
post-authorisation studies,32 but they are not always accessible in
practice.
• Evaluating study methods—Examine study protocols; are they well
designed? Are the right questions being asked? Are the methods for
answering the research questions appropriate? Current guidelines
for good study design are produced by the European Network of
Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance,33 and
researchers can evaluate studies against these standards.
• Monitor study progress—Analyse entries in study registers to consider
whether important milestones, such as submission of interim analyses
and final clinical study reports, are being achieved on time, as
specified in risk management plans.
• Examining results—Was the study carried out and analysed as
specified in the study protocol? For example, were pre-specified
primaryendpointsanalysed?Areresultstransparentlyandconsistently
reported across different study reports (are findings in the study
register fully consistent with those in a journal publication for
example)?
Patient and public participation in the process is also vital,
particularly at the design stage. Only through patient and public
involvement from the outset can we be sure that regulator mandated
studies tackle the issues that matter most to patients. Moreover,
specific informed consent should be obtained from participants in
post-authorisation studies to allow sharing of individual patient
data for independent scrutiny.
Independent scrutiny matters. Mayo-Wilson and colleagues, for
example, found serious discrepancies in the reporting of trials of
gabapentin for neuropathic pain and quetiapine for bipolar
depression across different sources. These discrepancies among
key trial characteristics, such as effect size and significance level,
were large enough to influence the interpretation of trial results
affecting drug approval and further research.34 Similar scrutiny of
post-authorisation studies has also identified major inconsistencies
and inaccuracies; for example, a post-authorisation study of
dabigatran etexilate for patients with moderate renal impairment
having hip or knee replacement surgery saw important changes in
sample size and an interim analysis that occurred between the
protocol and the final study report (which was late).35 36
Contrary to the current process, whereby regulators and drug
companiesnegotiatepost-authorisationrequirementsbehindclosed
doors, we argue for an open review of proposed study designs by
independent scientists and patients, tackling issues such as study
objectives, special populations of interest, study size and duration,
primary and secondary outcomes, and the optimal time frame for
reporting results. Such transparency is of even greater importance
in view of emerging reports of “poor research conduct, lax data
management, and a lack of regulatory oversight” at one of the
contract research companies involved in a pivotal covid-19 vaccine
trial.37
To illustrate the range of post-authorisation studies in need of third
party scrutiny, we compiled a list of 21 studies specified in risk
management plans after conditional authorisation by EMA of
Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines against covid-19 (see
supplementary table on bmj.com). Study protocols or summary
information were available for only five of the 13 Pfizer-BioNTech
studies, and five of the eight Moderna studies. Two Pfizer-BioNTech
studies aimed to inform the development of new versions of the
vaccine or to study the adverse effects of a booster dose in healthy
populations and immunocompromised patients (C4591001,
BNT162-01 Cohort 13). Similarly, two Moderna studies aimed to test
the effects of different doses or a booster dose on serious adverse
events and immunogenicity as primary end points in healthy
populations (20-0003, mRNA-1273-P201). One of the more interesting
studies in the risk management plan (EU-PAS 40404) evaluates
safety outcomes of four different vaccines in specific populations
of interest (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Janssen).
EU-PAS 40404 is also the only study independent of vaccine
manufacturers.
We could not locate either a protocol or summary information for
the other eight Pfizer-BioNTech and three Moderna studies. Judging
by the titles, some might provide information on hard outcomes
such as severe covid-19 or hospital admissions (C4591011, C4591012,
W1235284, W1235286). But the lack of publicly available study
documents indicates that these studies have not been prioritised
and remain at a very early stage.
The post-authorisation studies being prioritised by manufacturers
seem to be those aimed at developing new vaccines or obtaining
approval for additional doses of the current vaccines. The need for
data on hard outcomes such as hospital and intensive care
admissions or death in moderate or high risk populations is being
overlooked.

Accessing study documents
Documents and data from post-authorisation studies can be
accessed from databases or registers by searching for the trial
identification numbers specified in each vaccine’s risk management
plan (see supplementary table). Some of the most important studies
for covid-19 vaccines are continuations of phase III trials, required
by regulators. Fortunately, proactive release of key trial documents
such as clinical study reports is expected in Europe following EU
regulation 536/2014.38 Although not fully implemented yet, the EMA
has started publishing documents from EU trials in the European
Clinical Trials Register, making public important information on
trial protocols, status, and clinical study reports.39 Likewise, clinical
study reports and other documents that supported conditional
market authorisation are now available on the EMA’s Clinical Data
Publication website.40
The EMA plans to launch its new clinical trials information system
in January 2022 as a single entry point for submitting clinical trial
data in the EU. Clinical study reports and possibly other information
in this system will be made public, subject to EU transparency rules.
The EMA says that the system is already fully functional and that
researchers should consider participating in its training programme
on how to use it. The EMA is currently implementing a data analysis
and real world interrogation network to generate timely evidence
on the safety and effectiveness of medicines from healthcare
databases.
To date, the EMA is the only regulator that provides access to data
and documents from mandated post-authorisation studies, making
summary data from protocols and study reports available through
the EU electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies (EU PAS
Register).32 The register allows for public access to administrative
details, study objectives and main results, methodological details,
and published documents including the full protocol with a signed
checklist, conflicts of interest and the signed code of conduct, but
not all these data are consistently provided. Basic study information
from post-authorisation studies required by the EMA can also be
found in other registration databases such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
Whendataandotherinformationarenotpubliclyavailable,freedom
ofinformationrequestsforanyrecordsheldbytheagency,including
unpublished clinical data, can be made by EU residents using an
online form on EMA’s website.41 Unfortunately, releases can be
delayed,42 and documents are often released with redactions (to
protect privacy or confidential business information) that may
impede researchers’ efforts.
Although the US FDA and Health Canada also require
post-authorisation studies, no proactive release of trial documents
and data is yet in place. Health Canada does, however, provide
easy, public access to clinical information related to studies
underpinning authorisation.43 44 To our knowledge, the UK
Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency does not
have any plans for proactive release of data.
Making it happen
As post-authorisation studies mandated contribute considerably to
assessment of the efficacy and safety of medicines and vaccines,
particularlythoseauthorisedthroughexpeditedprogrammes,public
access to data held by regulators is critical and should include
patient level data, if available. Access would ideally be established
at the planning stage to allow debate between regulators, marketing
authorisation holders, and the scientific community throughout
the process—from protocol preparation to submission of study
reports.
Independent researcher engagement with regulatory studies largely
remains an unfunded, voluntary effort. Funding bodies should
consider giving a higher priority to these endeavours as money
spent here would help improve the reliability, value, and timeliness
of important post-authorisation studies. Journals also have a role
in providing a place for third party critiques and analyses of
post-authorisation studies, similar to the way many journals
endorsed the restoring invisible and abandoned trials (RIAT)
initiative, in which third party researchers reanalyse underlying
study data independent of the original trialists.45
Both the scientific community and the public increasingly perceive
the urgent need for independent evaluation of regulatory
requirements.46 Rigorous evaluation of covid-19 vaccines’ safety
and efficacy in the post-authorisation phase is critically important
and increasingly possible thanks to strengthened transparency
requirements for regulators. Without external scrutiny, we risk
repeating the mistakes of the past—with many promises made but
little follow through.
Regulatory agencies should continue to improve transparency by
granting full access to all regulatory documents and available study
data. And researchers should get involved in the independent
evaluation of this material. Regulatory research (third party
appraisal of industry funded studies mandated by regulatory
authorities), independent of manufacturers and political interests,
might relieve pressure on regulators47 and improve public trust by
helping to ensure the safety, efficacy, and value of all medicines,
including covid-19 vaccines—particularly those authorised through
expedited regulatory pathways.
Key messages
• Expedited approval of medicines by regulatory authorities often
postpones the evaluation of important efficacy and safety endpoints
until after medicines are widely available
• For such medicines, well designed, conducted, analysed, and reported
post-authorisation studies are vital to ensuring confidence that
benefits actually outweigh risks
• Covid-19 vaccines were widely administered following “conditional”
authorisation based on short clinical trials, when important questions
remained unanswered
• Regulators require sponsors to carry out post-authorisation safety
and efficacy studies, which often remain relatively unknown outside
of specialist circles, and there is a history of insufficient compliance
and regulatory oversight
• Independent researchers must help scrutinise the design, conduct,
data reporting, and overall transparency of post-authorisation studies
mandated by regulators, particularly for global public health
interventions such as covid-19 vaccines
