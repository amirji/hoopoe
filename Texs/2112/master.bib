	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We present high-pass filtered NACO and SINFONI images of the newly discovered stars S4711–S4715 between 2004 and 2016. Our deep H+K-band (SINFONI) and K-band (NACO) data show the S-cluster star S4711 on a highly eccentric trajectory around Sgr A* with an orbital period of 7.6 yr and a periapse distance of 144 au to the supermassive black hole (SMBH). S4711 is hereby the star with the shortest orbital period and the smallest mean distance to the SMBH during its orbit to date. The used high-pass filtered images are based on coadded data sets to improve the signal to noise. The spectroscopic SINFONI data let us determine detailed stellar properties of S4711 like the mass and the rotational velocity. The faint S-cluster star candidates, S4712–S4715, can be observed in a projected distance to Sgr A* of at least temporarily ≤120 mas. From these stars, S4714 is the most prominent, with an orbital period of 12 yr and an eccentricity of 0.985. The stars S4712–S4715 show similar properties, with magnitudes and stellar masses comparable to those of S4711. The MCMC simulations determine confidently precise uncertainties for the orbital elements of S62 and S4711–S4715. The presence of S4711 in addition to S55, S62, and the also newly found star S4714 implies a population of faint stars that can be found at distances to Sgr A* that are comparable to the size of our solar system. These short orbital time period stars in the dense cluster around the SMBH in the center of our Galaxy are perfect candidates to observe gravitational effects such as the periapse shift.}

volume={17},
number={3},
pages={261-272},
abstract={SciPy is an open-source scientific computing library for the Python programming language. Since its initial release in 2001, SciPy has become a de facto standard for leveraging scientific algorithms in Python, with over 600 unique code contributors, thousands of dependent packages, over 100,000 dependent repositories and millions of downloads per year. In this work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and development practices of SciPy 1.0 and highlight some recent technical developments.},

  Abstract                 = {Hypervelocity stars (HVSs), which are observed in the Galactic halo, are believed to be accelerated to large velocities by a process of tidal disruption of binary stars passing close to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) which resides in the center of the Galaxy. It is, however, still unclear where these relatively young stars were born and what dynamical process pushed them to nearly radial orbits around the SMBH. In this paper we investigate the possibility that the young binaries originated from a thin eccentric disk, similar to the one currently observed in the Galactic center. By means of direct N-body simulations, we follow the dynamical evolution of an initially thin and eccentric disk of stars with a 100% binary fraction orbiting around the SMBH. Such a configuration leads to Kozai-Lidov oscillations of orbital elements, bringing a considerable number of binaries to the close vicinity of the black hole. Subsequent tidal disruption of these binaries accelerates one of their components to velocities well above the escape velocity from the SMBH, while the second component becomes tightly bound to the SMBH. We describe the main kinematic properties of the escaping and tightly bound stars within our model, and compare them qualitatively to the properties of the observed HVSs and S-stars, respectively. The most prominent feature is strong anisotropy in the directions of the escaping stars, which is observed for Galactic HVSs but has not yet been explained.},

  abstract      = {The origin of the nuclear star cluster in the centre of our Galaxy is still unknown. One possibility is that it formed after the disruption of stellar clusters that spiralled into the Galactic Centre due to dynamical friction. We trace the formation of the nuclear star cluster around the central black hole, using state-of-the-art N-body simulations, and follow the dynamics of the neutron stars born in the clusters. We then estimate the number of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) that are released in the nuclear star cluster during its formation. The assembly and tidal dismemberment of globular clusters lead to a population of MSPs distributed over a radius of about 20 pc, with a peak near 3 pc. No clustering is found on the subparsec scale. We simulate the detectability of this population with future radio telescopes like the MeerKAT radio telescope and SKA1, and find that about an order of 10 MSPs can be observed over this large volume, with a paucity of MSPs within the central parsec. This helps discriminating this scenario from the in situ formation model for the nuclear star cluster that would predict an overabundance of MSPs closer to the black hole. We then discuss the potential contribution of our MSP population to the gamma-ray excess at the Galactic Centre.},

  Abstract                 = {Nuclear stellar cluster (NSCs) are known to exist around
 massive black holes (MBHs) in galactic nuclei. Two
 formation scenarios were suggested for their origin: (1)
 buildup of NSCs from consecutive infall of stellar clusters
 and (2) continuous in situ star formation. Though the
 cluster infall scenario has been extensively studied, the
 in situ formation scenario has been hardly explored. Here
 we use Fokker-Planck (FP) calculations to study the effects
 of star formation on the buildup of NSCs and its
 implications for their long-term evolution and their
 resulting structure. We use the FP equation to describe the
 evolution of stellar populations and add appropriate source
 terms to account for the effects of newly formed stars. We
 show that continuous star formation even 1-2 pc away from
 the MBH can lead to the buildup of an NSC with properties
 similar to those of the Milky Way NSC. We find that the
 structure of the old stellar population in the NSC with in
 situ star formation could be very similar to the
 steady-state Bahcall-Wolf cuspy structure. However, its
 younger populations do not yet achieve a steady state. In
 particular, formed/evolved NSCs with in situ star formation
 contain differential age-segregated stellar populations
 that are not yet fully mixed. Younger stellar populations
 formed in the outer regions of the NSC have a cuspy
 structure toward the NSC outskirts, while showing a
 core-like distribution inward, with younger populations
 having larger core sizes. In principal, such a structure
 can give rise to an apparent core-like radial distribution
 of younger stars, as observed in the Galactic center.},

 nuclei (AGNs) and the distribution of their accretion rates
 do not depend on the stellar masses of their host galaxies,
 contrary to previous studies. We use hard (2-10 keV) X-ray
 data from three extragalactic fields (XMM-LSS, COSMOS, and
 ELAIS-S1) with redshifts from the Prism Multi-object Survey
 to identify 242 AGNs with L 2-10 keV = 1042-44 erg s-1
 within a parent sample of ~25,000 galaxies at 0.2 < z < 1.0
 over ~3.4 deg2 and to i ~ 23. We find that although the
 fraction of galaxies hosting an AGN at fixed X-ray
 luminosity rises strongly with stellar mass, the
 distribution of X-ray luminosities is independent of mass.
 Furthermore, we show that the probability that a galaxy
 will host an AGN can be defined by a universal Eddington
 ratio distribution that is independent of the host galaxy
 stellar mass and has a power-law shape with slope -0.65.
 These results demonstrate that AGNs are prevalent at all
 stellar masses in the range 9.5 and that the same physical
 processes regulate AGN activity in all galaxies in this
 stellar mass range. While a higher AGN fraction may be
 observed in massive galaxies, this is a selection effect
 related to the underlying Eddington ratio distribution. We
 also find that the AGN fraction drops rapidly between z ~ 1
 and the present day and is moderately enhanced (factor ~2)
 in galaxies with blue or green optical colors.
 Consequently, while AGN activity and star formation appear
 to be globally correlated, we do not find evidence that the
 presence of an AGN is related to the quenching of star
 formation or the color transformation of galaxies.},

  Abstract                 = {The tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes
 (SMBH) lights up dormant systems and can be used to probe
 accretion and outflow processes. Theoretical calculations
 indicate that most tidal disruption events (TDEs) lead to
 super-Eddington accretion, which in turn drives outflows.
 The discovery of luminous radio emission from the
 $\gamma$-ray TDE Sw J1644+57 revealed the formation of a
 relativistic jetted outflow, but such events represent
 $\lesssim 1\%$ of the TDE population. Direct evidence for
 outflows in the bulk of the TDE population, discovered
 through optical, ultraviolet (UV), and X-ray observations,
 has been lacking. Here we report the discovery of transient
 radio emission from the nearby optically-discovered TDE
 ASASSN-14li (distance of 90 Mpc), making it the first
 normal TDE detected in the radio, and unambiguously
 pointing to the formation of a non-relativistic outflow
 with a kinetic energy of $\approx 10^{48}$ erg, a velocity
 of $\approx 12,000-39,000$ km s$^{-1}$, and a mass of
 $\approx 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$. We show that the
 outflow was ejected on 2014 August 11-25, in agreement with
 an independent estimate of the timing of super-Eddington
 accretion based on the optical, UV, and X-ray observations,
 and that the ejected mass corresponds to about $1-10\%$ of
 the mass accreted in the super-Eddington phase. The
 temporal evolution of the radio emission also uncovers the
 circumnuclear density profile, $\rho(R)\propto R^{-2.6}$ on
 a scale of about 0.01 pc, a scale that cannot be probed via
 direct measurements even in the nearest SMBHs. Our
 discovery of radio emission from the nearest TDE to date,
 with a radio luminosity lower than all previous limits,
 indicates that non-relativistic outflows are ubiquitous in
 TDEs, and that future, more sensitive, radio surveys will
 uncover similar events.},

  Abstract                 = {Most galactic nuclei harbor a massive black hole (MBH),
 whose birth and evolution are closely linked to those of
 its host galaxy. The unique conditions near the MBH: high
 velocity and density in the steep potential of a massive
 singular relativistic object, lead to unusual modes of
 stellar birth, evolution, dynamics and death. A complex
 network of dynamical mechanisms, operating on multiple
 timescales, deflect stars to orbits that intercept the MBH.
 Such close encounters lead to energetic interactions with
 observable signatures and consequences for the evolution of
 the MBH and its stellar environment. Galactic nuclei are
 astrophysical laboratories that test and challenge our
 understanding of MBH formation, strong gravity, stellar
 dynamics, and stellar physics. I review from a theoretical
 perspective the wide range of stellar phenomena that occur
 near MBHs, focusing on the role of stellar dynamics near an
 isolated MBH in a relaxed stellar cusp.},

  Abstract                 = {We show that the mass-segregation solution for the
 steady-state distribution of stars around a massive black
 hole (MBH) has two branches: the well known
 weak-segregation solution and a strong segregation
 solution, which is analyzed here for the first time. The
 nature of the solution depends on the heavy-to-light
 stellar mass ratio MH /ML and on the unbound population
 number ratio NH /NL , through the relaxational coupling
 parameter Delta = 4NHM 2 H /[NLM 2 L (3 + MH /ML )]. When
 the heavy stars are relatively common (Delta Gt 1), they
 scatter frequently on each other. This efficient
 self-coupling leads to weak mass segregation, where the
 stars form nâˆ r^{-alpha_{M}} mass-dependent cusps near
 the MBH, with indices alpha H = 7/4 for the heavy stars and
 3/2 < alpha L < 7/4 for the light stars (i.e. max(alpha H -
 alpha L ) sime 1/4). However, when the heavy stars are
 relatively rare (Delta Lt 1), they scatter mostly on light
 stars, sink to the center by dynamical friction and settle
 into a much steeper cusp with 2 lsim alpha H lsim 11/4,
 while the light stars form a 3/2 < alpha L < 7/4 cusp,
 resulting in strong segregation (i.e., max(alpha H - alpha
 L ) sime 1). We show that the present-day mass function of
 evolved stellar populations with a universal initial mass
 function (coeval or continuously star forming) separates
 into two distinct mass scales, ~1 M sun of main sequence
 and compact dwarfs, and ~10 M sun of stellar black holes
 (SBHs), and have Delta < 0.1. We conclude that it is likely
 that many relaxed galactic nuclei are strongly segregated.
 We review indications of strong segregation in observations
 of the Galactic center and in results of numeric
 simulations, and briefly list possible implications of a
 very high central concentration of SBHs around an MBH.},

  Abstract                 = {Massive black holes (MBHs) in galactic nuclei are believed
 to be surrounded by a high-density stellar cluster, whose
 mass is mostly in hard-to-detect faint stars and compact
 remnants. Such dark cusps dominate the dynamics near the
 MBH: a dark cusp in the Galactic center (GC) of the Milky
 Way would strongly affect orbital tests of general
 relativity there; on cosmic scales, dark cusps set the
 rates of gravitational wave emission events from compact
 remnants that spiral into MBHs, and they modify the rates
 of tidal disruption events, to list only some implications.
 A recently discovered long-period massive young binary
 (with period P 12 <~ 1 yr, total mass M_{12}\sim {\cal
 O}(100\, M_{\odot }), and age T 12 ~ 6 Ã— 106 yr), only
 ~0.1 pc from the Galactic MBH, sets a lower bound on the
 stellar two-body relaxation timescale there, min t
 rlxvprop(P 12/M 12)2/3 T 12 ~ 107 yr, and, correspondingly,
 an upper bound on the stellar number density, \max n_{\star
 }\sim {few\times }10^{8}/\langle M_{\star }^{2}\rangle
 \,{pc^{-3}} (\langle M_{\star }^{2}\rangle ^{1/2} is the
 rms stellar mass), based on the binary's survival against
 evaporation by the dark cusp. However, a conservative
 dynamical estimate, the drain limit, implies t_{{rlx}} \gt
 {\cal O}({10^{8}}\,{yr}). Such massive binaries are thus
 too short-lived and tightly bound to constrain a dense
 relaxed dark cusp. We explore here in detail the use of
 longer-period, less massive, and longer-lived binaries (P
 12 ~ few yr, M 12 ~ 2-4 M &sun;, T 12 ~ 108-1010 yr),
 presently just below the detection threshold, for probing
 the dark cusp and develop the framework for translating
 their future detections among the giants in the GC into
 dynamical constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {Using Chandra X-ray observations of nine nearby, X-ray
 luminous elliptical galaxies with good optical velocity
 dispersion measurements, we show that a tight correlation
 exists between the Bondi accretion rates calculated from
 the observed gas temperature and density profiles and
 estimated black hole masses, and the power emerging from
 these systems in relativistic jets. The jet powers, which
 are inferred from the energies and time-scales required to
 inflate cavities observed in the surrounding X-ray emitting
 gas, can be related to the accretion rates using a
 power-law model of the form log(PBondi/1043ergs-1) = A +
 Blog(Pjet/1043ergs-1), with A = 0.65 +/- 0.16 and B = 0.77
 +/- 0.20. Our results show that a significant fraction of
 the energy associated with the rest mass of material
 entering the Bondi accretion radius (2.2+1.0-0.7 per cent,
 for Pjet = 1043ergs-1) eventually emerges in the
 relativistic jets. The data also hint that this fraction
 may rise slightly with increasing jet power. Our results
 have significant implications for studies of accretion, jet
 formation and galaxy formation. The observed tight
 correlation suggests that the Bondi formulae provide a
 reasonable description of the accretion process in these
 systems, despite the likely presence of magnetic pressure
 and angular momentum in the accreting gas. The similarity
 of the PBondi and Pjet values argues that a significant
 fraction of the matter entering the accretion radius flows
 down to regions close to the black holes, where the jets
 are presumably formed. The tight correlation between PBondi
 and Pjet also suggests that the accretion flows are
 approximately stable over time-scales of a few million
 years. Our results show that the black hole `engines' at
 the hearts of large elliptical galaxies and groups can feed
 back sufficient energy to stem cooling and star formation,
 leading naturally to the observed exponential cut off at
 the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the production of main-sequence mergers of
 tidally synchronized primordial short-period binaries. The
 principal ingredients of our calculation are the angular
 momentum loss rates inferred from the spin-down of open
 cluster stars and the distribution of binary properties in
 young open clusters. We compare our results with the
 expected number of systems that experience mass transfer in
 the post-main-sequence phases of evolution and compute the
 uncertainties in the theoretical predictions. We estimate
 that main-sequence mergers can account for the observed
 number of single blue stragglers in M67. Applied to the
 blue straggler population, this implies that such mergers
 are responsible for about one-quarter of the population of
 halo blue metal-poor stars and at least one-third of the
 blue stragglers in open clusters for systems older than 1
 Gyr. The observed trends as a function of age are
 consistent with a saturated angular momentum loss rate for
 rapidly rotating tidally synchronized systems. The
 predicted number of blue stragglers from main-sequence
 mergers alone is comparable to the number observed in
 globular clusters, indicating that the net effect of
 dynamical interactions in dense stellar environments is to
 reduce rather than increase the blue straggler population.
 A population of subturnoff mergers of order 3%-4% of the
 upper main sequence population is also predicted for stars
 older than 4 Gyr, which is roughly comparable to the small
 population of highly Li-depleted halo dwarfs. Other
 observational tests are discussed.},

 to study the long-term dynamical evolution of stellar black
 holes (BHs) at the Galactic center (GC) and to put
 constraints on their number and mass distribution. Starting
 from models that have not yet achieved a state of
 collisional equilibrium, we find that timescales associated
 with cusp regrowth can be longer than the Hubble time. Our
 results cast doubts on standard models that postulate high
 densities of BHs near the GC and motivate studies that
 start from initial conditions that correspond to
 well-defined physical models. For the first time, we
 consider the distribution of BHs in a dissipationless model
 for the formation of the Milky Way nuclear cluster (NC), in
 which massive stellar clusters merge to form a compact
 nucleus. We simulate the consecutive merger of ~10 clusters
 containing an inner dense sub-cluster of BHs. After the
 formed NC is evolved for ~5 Gyr, the BHs do form a steep
 central cusp, while the stellar distribution maintains
 properties that resemble those of the GC NC. Finally, we
 investigate the effect of BH perturbations on the motion of
 the GC S-stars as a means of constraining the number of the
 perturbers. We find that reproducing the quasi-thermal
 character of the S-star orbital eccentricities requires >~
 1000 BHs within 0.1 pc of Sgr A*. A dissipationless
 formation scenario for the GC NC is consistent with this
 lower limit and therefore could reconcile the need for high
 central densities of BHs (to explain the S-stars orbits)
 with the "missing-cusp" problem of the GC giant star
 population.},

  Abstract                 = {Studying how nuclear star clusters (NSCs) form and how
 they are related to the growth of the central massive black
 holes (MBHs) and their host galaxies is fundamental for our
 understanding of the evolution of galaxies and the
 processes that have shaped their central structures. We
 present the results of a semi-analytical galaxy formation
 model that follows the evolution of dark matter halos along
 merger trees, as well as that of the baryonic components.
 This model allows us to study the evolution of NSCs in a
 cosmological context, by taking into account the growth of
 NSCs due to both dynamical-friction-driven migration of
 stellar clusters and star formation triggered by infalling
 gas, while also accounting for dynamical heating from
 (binary) MBHs. We find that in situ star formation
 contributes a significant fraction (up to ~80%) of the
 total mass of NSCs in our model. Both NSC growth through in
 situ star formation and that through star cluster migration
 are found to generate NSC---host galaxy scaling
 correlations that are shallower than the same correlations
 for MBHs. We explore the role of galaxy mergers on the
 evolution of NSCs and show that observational data on
 NSC---host galaxy scaling relations provide evidence of
 partial erosion of NSCs by MBH binaries in luminous
 galaxies. We show that this observational feature is
 reproduced by our models, and we make predictions about the
 NSC and MBH occupation fraction in galaxies. We conclude by
 discussing several implications for theories of NSC
 formation.},

  Abstract                 = {In one widely discussed model for the formation of nuclear star clusters (NSCs), massive globular clusters spiral into the center of a galaxy and merge to form the nucleus. It is now known that at least some NSCs coexist with supermassive black holes (SMBHs); this is the case, for instance, in the Milky Way. In this paper, we investigate how the presence of an SMBH at the center of the Milky Way impacts the merger hypothesis for the formation of its NSC. Starting from a model consisting of a low-density nuclear stellar disk and the SMBH, we use direct N-body simulations to follow the successive inspiral and merger of globular clusters. The clusters are started on circular orbits of radius 20 pc, and their initial masses and radii are set up in such a way as to be consistent with the galactic tidal field at that radius. These clusters, decayed orbitally in the central region due to their large mass, were followed in their inspiral events; as a result, the total accumulated mass by ?10 clusters is about 1.5 × 107 M ?. Each cluster is disrupted by the SMBH at a distance of roughly 1 pc. The density profile that results after the final inspiral event is characterized by a core of roughly this radius and an envelope with density that falls off ? ~ r -2. These properties are similar to those of the Milky Way NSC, with the exception of the core size, which in the Milky Way is somewhat smaller. But by continuing the evolution of the model after the final inspiral event, we find that the core shrinks substantially via gravitational encounters in a time (when scaled to the Milky Way) of 10 Gyr as the stellar distribution evolves toward a Bahcall-Wolf cusp. We also show that the luminosity function of the Milky Way NSC is consistent with the hypothesis that 1/2 of the mass comes from old (~10 Gyr) stars, brought in by globular clusters, with the other half due to continuous star formation. We conclude that a model in which a large fraction of the mass of the Milky Way NSC is due to infalling globular clusters is consistent with existing observational constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivated by the recent detection of gravitational waves
 from the black hole binary merger GW150914, we study the
 dynamical evolution of (stellar-mass) black holes in
 galactic nuclei, where massive star clusters reside. With
 masses of Ëœ {10}7 {M}&sun; and sizes of only a few
 parsecs, nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are the densest
 stellar systems observed in the local universe and
 represent a robust environment where black hole binaries
 can dynamically form, harden, and merge. We show that due
 to their large escape speeds, NSCs can retain a large
 fraction of their merger remnants. Successive mergers can
 then lead to significant growth and produce black hole
 mergers of several tens of solar masses similar to GW150914
 and up to a few hundreds of solar masses, without the need
 to invoke extremely low metallicity environments. We use a
 semi-analytical approach to describe the dynamics of black
 holes in massive star clusters. Our models give a black
 hole binary merger rate of â‰ˆ 1.5 {{Gpc}}-3 {{yr}}-1 from
 NSCs, implying up to a few tens of possible detections per
 year with Advanced LIGO. Moreover, we find a local merger
 rate of Ëœ 1 {{Gpc}}-3 {{yr}}-1 for high mass black hole
 binaries similar to GW150914; a merger rate comparable to
 or higher than that of similar binaries assembled
 dynamically in globular clusters (GCs). Finally, we show
 that if all black holes receive high natal kicks, â‰³ 50
 {km} {{{s}}}-1, then NSCs will dominate the local merger
 rate of binary black holes compared to either GCs or
 isolated binary evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Context: High-mass microquasars are binary systems
 consisting of a massive star and an accreting compact
 object from which relativistic jets are launched. There is
 considerable observational evidence that winds of massive
 stars are clumpy. Individual clumps may interact with the
 jets in high-mass microquasars to produce outbursts of
 high-energy emission. Gamma-ray flares have been detected
 in some high-mass X-ray binaries, such as Cygnus X-1, and
 probably in LS 5039 and LS I+61 303. Aims: We predict the
 high-energy emission produced by the interaction between a
 jet and a clump of the stellar wind in a high-mass
 microquasar. Methods: Assuming a hydrodynamic scenario for
 the jet-clump interaction, we calculate the spectral energy
 distributions produced by the dominant non-thermal
 processes: relativistic bremsstrahlung, synchrotron and
 inverse Compton radiation, for leptons, and for hadrons,
 proton-proton collisions. Results: Significant levels of
 emission in X-rays (synchrotron), high-energy gamma rays
 (inverse Compton), and very high-energy gamma rays (from
 the decay of neutral pions) are predicted, with
 luminosities in the different domains in the range
 ~1032-1035 erg s-1. The spectral energy distributions vary
 strongly depending on the specific conditions. Conclusions:
 Jet-clump interactions may be detectable at high and very
 high energies, and provide an explanation for the fast TeV
 variability found in some high-mass X-ray binary systems.
 Our model can help to infer information about the
 properties of jets and clumpy winds by means of
 high-sensitivity gamma-ray astronomy.},

  Abstract                 = {Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are often present in spiral galaxies as well as resolved stellar nuclei (SNi) in elliptical galaxies centres. Ever growing observational data indicate the existence of correlations between the properties of these very dense central star aggregates and those of host galaxies, which constitute a significant constraint for the validity of theoretical models of their origin and formation. In the framework of the well-known `migratory and merger' model for NSC and SN formation, in this paper we obtain, first, by a simple argument the expected scaling of the NSC/SN mass with both time and parent galaxy velocity dispersion in the case of dynamical friction as dominant effect on the globular cluster system evolution. This generalizes previous results by Tremaine et al. and is in good agreement with available observational data showing a shallow correlation between NSC/SN mass and galactic bulge velocity dispersion. Moreover, we give statistical relevance to predictions of this formation model, obtaining a set of parameters to correlate with the galactic host parameters. We find that the correlations between the masses of NSCs in the migratory model and the global properties of the hosts reproduce quite well the observed correlations, supporting the validity of the migratory-merger model. In particular, one important result is the flattening or even decrease of the value of the NSC/SN mass obtained by the merger model as function of the galaxy mass for high values of the galactic mass, i.e. ?3 × 1011 M?, in agreement with some growing observational evidence.},

  Abstract                 = {The central region of the galaxy Henize 2-10 hosts a black hole (BH) candidate with a mass {Log}?ft({M}{BH}/{M}? \right)=6.3+/- 1.1. While this putative BH does not appear to coincide with any central stellar overdensity, it is surrounded by 11 young massive clusters with masses above 105 {M}? . The availability of high-quality data on the structure of the galaxy and the age and mass of the clusters provides excellent initial conditions for studying the dynamical evolution of Henize 2-10's nucleus. Here we present a set of N-body simulations in which we model the future evolution of the central clusters and the BH to understand whether and how they will merge to form a nuclear star cluster (NSC). NSCs are present in a majority of galaxies with stellar mass similar to Henize 2-10. While the results depend on the choice of initial conditions, we find that an NSC with mass {M}{NSC}? 4-6× {10}6 {M}? and effective radius {r}{NSC}? 2.6-4.1 pc will form within 0.2 Gyr. This work is the first showing, in a realistic realization of the host galaxy and its star cluster system, that the formation of a bright nucleus is a process that can happen after the formation of a central massive BH leading to a composite NSC+BH central system. The cluster merging process does not significantly affect the kinematics of the BH; when a stationary state is reached, its position changes by ? 1 pc and its velocity by \lt 2 km s-1.},

  Abstract                 = {The Milky Way centre exhibits an intense flux in the gamma and X-ray bands, whose origin is partly ascribed to the possible presence of a large population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and cataclysmic variables (CVs), respectively. However, the number of sources required to generate such an excess is much larger than what is expected from in situ star formation and evolution, opening a series of questions about the formation history of the Galactic nucleus. In this paper we make use of direct $N$-body simulations to investigate whether these sources could have been brought to the Galactic centre by a population of star clusters that underwent orbital decay and formed the Galactic nuclear star cluster (NSC). Our results suggest that the gamma ray emission is compatible with a population of MSPs that were mass segregated in their parent clusters, while the X-ray emission is consistent with a population of CVs born via dynamical interactions in dense star clusters. Combining observations with our modelling, we explore how the observed $\gamma$ ray flux can be related to different NSC formation scenarios. Finally, we show that the high-energy emission coming from the galactic central regions can be used to detect black holes heavier than $10^5\Ms$ in nearby dwarf galaxies.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the evolution of triple, non-hierarchical, black hole (BH) systems making use of 29,000 3-body simulations. Varying the mutual orbital inclination, the three BH masses and the inner and outer eccentricities, we show that retrograde, nearly planar configurations leads to a significant shrinkage of the inner binary. We found an universal trend of triple systems, that they tend to evolve toward prograde configurations, independently on the initial conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the orbital flip, driven by the torque exerted from the outer BH on the inner binary (BHB), leads in general to tighter inner orbits. In some cases, the resulting BHB undergoes coalescence within a Hubble time, releasing gravitational waves (GWs). Frequently, the inner BHB merger occurs after a component swap between one of its components and the outer BH. The mass spectrum of the BHBs that underwent the component exchange differs significantly from the case in which the BHB merge without any swap. A large fraction of merging BHBs with initial separation 1 AU enter the 0.001-0.1 Hz frequency band with large eccentricities, possibly being detected by the next generation of detectors. Mergers originating from initially tighter BHB (a ~ 0.01 AU), instead, have a large probability to have eccentricities above 0.7 in the 1 Hz band. Intriguingly, we found that the chirp mass of at least 3 of the GW sources detected by LIGO (GW150914, GW170814 and GW170104) lie in the most probable range of chirp masses for coalescing BHBs formed in a non-hierarchical triple.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the results of a Palomar Transient Factory
 (PTF) archival search for blue transients that lie in the
 magnitude range between "normal" core-collapse and
 superluminous supernovae (i.e., with -21 <= M R (peak) <= -
 19). Of the six events found after excluding all
 interacting Type IIn and Ia-CSM supernovae, three (PTF09ge,
 09axc, and 09djl) are coincident with the centers of their
 hosts, one (10iam) is offset from the center, and a precise
 offset cannot be determined for two (10nuj and 11glr). All
 the central events have similar rise times to the He-rich
 tidal disruption candidate PS1-10jh, and the event with the
 best-sampled light curve also has similar colors and
 power-law decay. Spectroscopically, PTF09ge is He-rich,
 while PTF09axc and 09djl display broad hydrogen features
 around peak magnitude. All three central events are in low
 star formation hosts, two of which are E+A galaxies. Our
 spectrum of the host of PS1-10jh displays similar
 properties. PTF10iam, the one offset event, is different
 photometrically and spectroscopically from the central
 events, and its host displays a higher star formation rate.
 Finding no obvious evidence for ongoing galactic nuclei
 activity or recent star formation, we conclude that the
 three central transients likely arise from the tidal
 disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. We
 compare the spectra of these events to tidal disruption
 candidates from the literature and find that all of these
 objects can be unified on a continuous scale of spectral
 properties. The accumulated evidence of this expanded
 sample strongly supports a tidal disruption origin for this
 class of nuclear transients.},

  Abstract                 = {Swift J1357.2-0933 is a confirmed very faint black hole
 X-ray transient and has a short estimated orbital period of
 2.8 h. We observed Swift J1357.2-0933 for Ëœ50 ks with
 XMM-Newton in 2013 July during its quiescent state. The
 source is clearly detected at a 0.5-10 keV unabsorbed flux
 of Ëœ3 Ã— 10-15 erg cm-2 s-1. If the source is located at a
 distance of 1.5 kpc (as suggested in the literature), this
 would imply a luminosity of Ëœ8 Ã— 1029 erg s-1, making it
 the faintest detected quiescent black hole low-mass X-ray
 binary. This would also imply that there is no indication
 of a reversal in the quiescence X-ray luminosity versus
 orbital period diagram down to 2.8 h, as has been predicted
 theoretically and recently supported by the detection of
 the 2.4 h orbital period black hole MAXI J1659-152 at a
 0.5-10 keV X-ray luminosity of Ëœ1.2 Ã— 1031 erg s-1.
 However, there is considerable uncertainty in the distance
 of Swift J1357.2-0933 and it may be as distant as 6.3 kpc.
 In this case, its quiescent luminosity would be LX Ëœ 1.3
 Ã— 1031 erg s-1, i.e. similar to MAXI J1659-152 and hence,
 it would support the existence of such a bifurcation
 period. We also detected the source in optical at r' Ëœ
 22.3 mag with the Liverpool telescope, simultaneously to
 our X-ray observation. The X-ray/optical luminosity ratio
 of Swift J1357.2-0933 agrees with the expected value for a
 black hole at this range of quiescent X-ray luminosities.},

 possible mechanism for overcoming the ``last parsec''
 problem and allowing the most massive black hole binaries

 if gas disks also catalyze the merger of the somewhat lower
 mass binaries detectable with the Laser Interferometer
 Space Antenna (LISA), then there may be a purely
 gravitational wave signature of the role of gas in the form
 of a small but finite eccentricity just prior to merger.
 Numerical simulations suggest that eccentricity, excited by
 the interaction between the binary and surrounding gas
 disk, is only partially damped during the final phase of
 gravitational radiation-driven inspiral. We estimate a
 typical eccentricity at 1 week prior to coalescence of
 e\~{}0.01. Higher terminal eccentricities, which can
 approach e=0.1, are possible if the binary has an extreme
 mass ratio. The detection of even a small eccentricity
 prior to merger by LISA provides a possible discriminant
 between gas-driven inspirals and those effected by stellar
 processes.},

  Abstract                 = {The existing theory of density wave excitation in
 two-dimensional gaseous disks by imposed gravitational
 potentials makes approximations which prevent a direct
 analytical description of the shifts in effective positions
 of Lindblad resonances with respect to radii satisfying
 orbital commensurability requirement, and of the so-called
 torque cutoff arising at large azimuthal numbers m of the
 perturbing potential's pattern. Both phenomena are related
 to the azimuthal forces acting on gas, neglected in the WKB
 approximation commonly used in the past. We extend previous
 theories of Lindblad resonance wherever necessary for a
 consistent analytical treatment of the problem,
 particularly for large m. Our analytical approach applies
 to wave excitation at Lindblad resonances in
 non-self-gravitating, two-dimensional gas layers
 (vertically averaged disks or fundamental vertical mode of
 three-dimensional disks). It explicitly includes the
 resonance shifts and torque cutoffs. The theory is valid
 for small perturbing potentials of arbitrary form
 (including highly localized potentials, e.g., point-mass
 potential, spiral potential with arbitrary pitch angle,
 etc.). We present a torque formula generalizing the
 standard Goldreich-Tremaine formula. Especially useful in
 the problem of disk-satellite interaction, the torque
 formula provides insight into the origin of the torque
 cutoff at m larger than the radius to thickness ratio of
 the disk. Qualitatively, the cutoff is an effect of: (i) a
 mild (power-law) intrinsic torque cutoff, independent of
 the radial profile of the imposed potential, and (ii) a
 sharp (exponential) cutoff due to shifts in effective
 resonance location away from the perturber. For m â†’ âˆž
 the latter effect causes the increasingly localized
 potential to decouple spatially from the wave generation
 region. A disk annulus surrounding the corotation radius of
 every m-armed potential, of width comparable with twice the
 vertical disk scale height, remains evanescent for waves
 excited by that harmonic and does not contribute
 significantly to the total torque between the perturber and
 the disk. We discuss the role of gas viscosity,
 self-gravity, and the applicability of a two-dimensional
 analysis to Lindblad resonances in three-dimensional
 disks.},

  Abstract                 = {Using a generalized torque formula for Lindblad resonances
 in non-self-gravitating gaseous disks we study the
 interaction of disks with small, embedded bodies (not able
 to open a gap). For satellites on circular orbits, the
 generalized torque formula reproduces exactly the torque
 cutoff occurring at high azimuthal number m of the
 potential harmonics, originally found seminumerically by
 Goldreich \{\&\} Tremaine (1980) in the shearing
 coordinates representation. The cutoff is attributable to
 the shift in the effective Lindblad resonance position with
 respect to the nominal resonant radius given by the usual
 period commensurabilty requirement. We apply the theory to
 the problem of orbital eccentricity evolution of embedded
 satellites. We relax some of the assumptions implicit in
 previous calculations related to this problem, most
 importantly that of a spatially smooth perturbing
 potential. We treat the co-orbital and the external
 Lindblad resonances within a unified formalism. We
 calculate the total rate of eccentricity damping due to
 co-orbital resonances and the excitation due to external
 resonances, the former exceeding the latter by a factor
 roughly equal to 3, independent of the method of averaging
 over the vertical disk structure. In application to a solar
 nebula with embedded planetesimals, the timescales of
 eccentricity damping for a wide range of planetesimal
 masses are much shorter than those corresponding to either
 gas drag, planetesimal growth, or nebular lifetime, and
 thus relevant to the scenarios of planetary system
 formation. In application to large (radius > 10 m)
 particles in Saturn's rings we estimate that the
 eccentricity is damped on the orbital timescale},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the gravitational interaction of a
 generally eccentric binary star system with circumbinary
 and circumstellar gaseous disks. The disks are assumed to
 be coplanar with the binary, geometrically thin, and
 primarily governed by gas pressure and (turbulent)
 viscosity but not self-gravity. Both ordinary and eccentric
 Lindblad resonances are primarily responsible for
 truncating the disks in binaries with arbitrary
 eccentricity and nonextreme mass ratio. Starting from a
 smooth disk configuration, after the gravitational field of
 the binary truncates the disk on the dynamical timescale, a
 quasi-equilibrium is achieved, in which the resonant and
 viscous torques balance each other and any changes in the
 structure of the disk (e.g., due to global viscous
 evolution) occur slowly, preserving the average size of the
 gap. We analytically compute the approximate sizes of disks
 (or disk gaps) as a function of binary mass ratio and
 eccentricity in this quasi-equilibrium. Comparing the gap
 sizes with results of direct simulations using the smoothed
 particle hydrodynamics (SPH), we obtain a good agreement.
 As a by-product of the computations, we verify that
 standard SPH codes can adequately represent the dynamics of
 disks with moderate viscosity, Reynolds number R
 approximately 103. For typical viscous disk parameters, and
 with a denoting the binary semimajor axis, the inner edge
 location of a circumbinary disk varies from 1.8a to 2.6a
 with binary eccentricity increasing from 0 to 0.25. For
 eccentricities 0 less than e less than 0.75, the minimum
 separation between a component star and the circumbinary
 disk inner edge is greater than a. Our calculations are
 relevant, among others, to protobinary stars and the
 recently discovered T Tau pre-main-sequence binaries. We
 briefly examine the case of a pre-main-sequence
 spectroscopic binary GW Ori and conclude that circumbinary
 disk truncation to the size required by one proposed
 spectroscopic model cannot be due to Linblad resonances,
 even if the disk is nonviscous.},

 a quasi-linear flow analysis ordered by successive powers
 of a dimensionless spiral perturbing force, which is the
 ratio of imposed nonaxisymmetric gravitational to
 axisymmetric gravitational forces. Waves with mn arms are
 launched from a position where the wavenumber of a free
 wave matches n times the wavenumber of the spiral forcing.
 The launched short wave in the gas is an interarm feature
 that is more tightly wrapped than the stellar wave. The gas
 wave extracts energy and angular momentum from the stellar
 wave, causing it to damp. The application of the results to
 the stellar disk alone reveals even stronger damping, as
 stars undergo Landau damping of the short wave. For
 parameters in M81, damping times are less than 10 exp 9

  Abstract                 = {NGC 5905 was observed with ROSAT five times, three times
 during the ROSAT all-sky survey (RASS) and twice in the
 pointed observing mode. The soft X-ray properties of the
 nucleus of NGC 5905 derived from the RASS observations,
 namely high-amplitude flux variability on timescales of
 days, the extremely soft spectrum (photon index {GAMMA}=4),
 and high peak luminosity of L_X_=7x10^42^ergs/s, are all
 inconsistent with its optical classification as HII-type,
 i.e. starburst galaxy. During the pointed observations
 taken two years later, the X-ray luminosity was down by a
 factor of >80. Possible mechanisms, which can produce the
 high state, are discussed. Tidal disruption of a star near
 a central black hole is in good agreement with the
 observations.},

  Abstract                 = {We report the results of the first-epoch observation with
 the ACIS-I instrument on the Chandra X-Ray Observatory of
 Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the compact radio source
 associated with the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the
 dynamical center of the Milky Way. This observation
 produced the first X-ray (0.5-7 keV) spectroscopic image
 with arcsecond resolution of the central 17'Ã—17'
 (40pcÃ—40pc) of the Galaxy. We report the discovery of an
 X-ray source, CXOGC J174540.0-290027, coincident with Sgr
 A* within 0.27"+/-0.18". The probability of a false match
 is estimated to be <~0.5%. The spectrum is well fitted
 either by an absorbed power law with photon index Gamma~2.7
 or by an absorbed optically thin thermal plasma with kT~1.9
 keV and column density NH~1Ã—1023 cm-2. The observed flux
 in the 2-10 keV band is ~1.3Ã—10-13 ergs cm-2 s-1, and the
 absorption-corrected luminosity is ~2.4Ã—1033 ergs s-1. The
 X-ray emission at the position of Sgr A* is extended, with
 an intrinsic size of ~1.4" (FWHM), consistent with the
 Bondi accretion radius for a 2.6Ã—106 Msolar black hole. A
 compact component within the source flared by up to a
 factor of 3 over a period of ~1 hr at the start of the
 observation. The search for Kalpha line emission from iron
 was inconclusive, yielding an upper limit on the equivalent
 width of 2.2 keV. Several potential stellar origins for the
 X-ray emission at Sgr A* are considered, but we conclude
 that the various properties of the source favor accretion
 onto the SMBH as the origin for the bulk of the emission.
 These data are inconsistent with ``standard''
 advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) models or Bondi
 models, unless the accretion rate from stellar winds is
 much lower than anticipated. The central parsec of the
 Galaxy contains an ~1.3 keV plasma with electron density
 ne~26eta-1/2fcm-3, where etaf is the filling factor. This
 plasma should supply ~10-6 Msolar yr-1 of material to the
 accretion flow at the Bondi radius, whereas measurements of
 linear polarization at 150 GHz and above limit the
 accretion rate near the event horizon to <~10-8 Msolar
 yr-1, assuming an equipartition magnetic field. Taken
 together, the X-ray and radio results imply that outflows
 or convection are playing a role in ADAF models and
 subequipartition magnetic fields in Bondi models, or else
 the X-ray emission must be generated predominantly via the
 synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) process. The measured extent
 of the source and the detection of short timescale
 variability are evidence that the emission from Sgr A*
 contains both thermal and nonthermal emission components at
 comparable levels. We also discuss the complex structure of
 the X-ray emission from the Sgr A radio complex and along
 the Galactic plane. Morphological evidence is presented
 that Sgr A* and the H II region Sgr A West lie within the
 hot plasma in the central cavity of Sgr A East, which we
 interpret as a supernova remnant that may have passed
 through the position of the SMBH, leading to a period of
 increased activity that ended within the past ~300 yr.
 Similarly, we have discovered bright clumps of X-ray
 emission located on opposite sides of the Galactic plane,
 along a line passing through the central parsec of the
 Galaxy. The arrangement of these lobes suggests that Sgr A*
 may have experienced an earlier period of increased
 activity lasting several thousand years during which it
 expelled hot gas in a bipolar outflow oriented roughly
 perpendicular to the Galactic plane. Additionally, we
 present an analysis of stellar emission within the central
 parsec of the Galaxy.},

 relevant diffusion coefficients, the time-dependent
 Boltzmann equation is solved numerically, and solutions are
 found which satisfy the boundary conditions at both zero

 distribution function is approximately a power law

 that stars in bound orbits diffuse slowly down the

 black hole of less than or approximately 1000 solar masses

 binary (XRB) in Terzan 5, the third detected in this
 globular cluster, Swift J174805.3-244637 or Terzan 5 X-3.
 We find clear spectral hardening in Swift/XRT data during
 the outburst rise to the hard state, thanks to our early
 coverage (starting at LX ~ 4 ?1034 erg s-1) of the
 outburst. This hardening appears to be due to the decline
 in relative strength of a soft thermal component from the
 surface of the neutron star (NS) during the rise. We
 identify a Type I X-ray burst in Swift/XRT data with a long
 (16 s) decay time, indicative of hydrogen burning on the
 surface of the NS. We use Swift/BAT, MAXI/GSC,
 Chandra/ACIS, and Swift/XRT data to study the spectral
 changes during the outburst, identifying a clear
 hard-to-soft state transition. We use a Chandra/ACIS
 observation during outburst to identify the transient's
 position. Seven archival Chandra/ACIS observations show
 evidence for variations in Terzan 5 X-3's nonthermal
 component but not the thermal component during quiescence.
 The inferred long-term time-averaged mass accretion rate,
 from the quiescent thermal luminosity, suggests that if
 this outburst is typical and only slow cooling processes
 are active in the NS core, such outbursts should recur
 every ~10 yr.},

  Abstract                 = {47 Tuc X9 is a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) in the
 globular cluster 47 Tucanae, and was previously thought to
 be a cataclysmic variable. However, Miller-Jones et al.
 recently identified a radio counterpart to X9 (inferring a
 radio/X-ray luminosity ratio consistent with black hole
 LMXBs), and suggested that the donor star might be a white
 dwarf. We report simultaneous observations of X9 performed
 by Chandra, NuSTAR and Australia Telescope Compact Array.
 We find a clear 28.18 $\pm$ 0.02-min periodic modulation in
 the Chandra data, which we identify as the orbital period,
 confirming this system as an ultracompact X-ray binary. Our
 X-ray spectral fitting provides evidence for photoionized
 gas having a high oxygen abundance in this system, which
 indicates a C/O white dwarf donor. We also identify
 reflection features in the hard X-ray spectrum, making X9
 the faintest LMXB to show X-ray reflection. We detect an
 ~6.8-d modulation in the X-ray brightness by a factor of
 10, in archival Chandra, Swiftand ROSAT data. The
 simultaneous radio/X-ray flux ratio is consistent with
 either a black hole primary or a neutron star primary, if
 the neutron star is a transitional millisecond pulsar.
 Considering the measured orbital period (with other
 evidence of a white dwarf donor), and the lack of
 transitional millisecond pulsar features in the X-ray light
 curve, we suggest that this could be the first ultracompact
 black hole X-ray binary identified in our Galaxy.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the dynamics of stellar-mass black holes (BH) in
 star clusters with particular attention to the formation of
 BH-BH binaries, which are interesting as sources of
 gravitational waves (GW). In the present study, we examine
 the properties of these BH-BH binaries through direct
 N-body simulations of star clusters using the NBODY6 code
 on graphical processing unit platforms. We perform
 simulations for star clusters with <=105 low-mass stars
 starting from Plummer models with an initial population of
 BHs, varying the cluster mass and BH-retention fraction.
 Additionally, we do several calculations of star clusters
 confined within a reflective boundary mimicking only the
 core of a massive star cluster which can be performed much
 faster than the corresponding full cluster integration. We
 find that stellar-mass BHs with masses ~10Msolar segregate
 rapidly (~100 Myr time-scale) into the cluster core and
 form a dense subcluster of BHs within typically 0.2-0.5 pc
 radius. In such a subcluster, BH-BH binaries can be formed
 through three-body encounters, the rate of which can become
 substantial in dense enough BH cores. While most BH
 binaries are finally ejected from the cluster by recoils
 received during superelastic encounters with the single
 BHs, few of them harden sufficiently so that they can merge
 via GW emission within the cluster. We find that for
 clusters with N >~ 5 Ã— 104, typically 1-2 BH-BH mergers
 occur per cluster within the first ~4 Gyr of cluster
 evolution. Also for each of these clusters, there are a few
 escaping BH binaries that can merge within a Hubble time,
 most of the merger times being within a few Gyr. These
 results indicate that intermediate-age massive clusters
 constitute the most important class of candidates for
 producing dynamical BH-BH mergers. Old globular clusters
 cannot contribute significantly to the present-day BH-BH
 merger rate since most of the mergers from them would have
 occurred much earlier. On the other hand, young massive
 clusters with ages less that 50 Myr are too young to
 produce significant number of BH-BH mergers. We finally
 discuss the detection rate of BH-BH inspirals by the `Laser
 Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory' (LIGO) and
 `Advanced LIGO' GW detectors. Our results indicate that
 dynamical BH-BH binaries constitute the dominant channel
 for BH-BH merger detection.},

  Abstract                 = {In mergers of disk galaxies, gas plays a role quite out of
 proportion to its relatively modest contribution to the
 total mass. To study this behavior, we have included
 gasdynamics in self-consistent simulations of collisions
 between equal-mass disk galaxies. The large-scale dynamics
 of bridge- and tail-making, orbit decay, and merging are
 not much altered by the inclusion of a gaseous component.
 However, tidal forces during encounters cause otherwise
 stable disks to develop bars, and the gas in such barred
 disks, subjected to strong gravitational torques, flows
 toward the central regions where it may fuel the
 kiloparsec-scale starbursts seen in some interacting disk
 systems. Similar torques on the gas during the final stages
 of a collision yield massive gas concentrations in the
 cores of merger remnants, which may be plausibly identified
 with the molecular complexes seen in objects such as NGC
 520 and Arp 220. This result appears insensitive to the
 detailed microphysics of the gas, provided that radiative
 cooling is permitted. The inflowing gas can dramatically
 alter the stellar morphology of a merger remnant,
 apparently by deepening the potential well and thereby
 changing the boundaries between the major orbital
 families.},

 evolve into the small phase-space volume of unstable
 orbits, the ``loss cone,'' which take them into the MBH, or
 close enough to interact strongly with it. The resulting
 phenomena, e.g., tidal heating and disruption, binary
 capture and hyper-velocity star ejection, gravitational
 wave (GW) emission by inspiraling compact remnants, or
 hydrodynamical interactions with an accretion disk, can
 produce observable signatures and thereby reveal the MBH,
 affect its mass and spin evolution, test strong gravity,
 and probe stars and gas near the MBH. These continuous
 stellar loss and resupply processes shape the central
 stellar distribution. We investigate relativistic stellar
 dynamics near the loss cone of a non-spinning MBH in steady
 state, analytically and by Monte Carlo simulations of the
 diffusion of the orbital parameters. These take into
 account Newtonian mass precession due to enclosed stellar
 mass, in-plane precession due to general relativity,
 dissipation by GW, uncorrelated two-body relaxation,
 correlated resonant relaxation (RR), and adiabatic
 invariance due to secular precession, using a rigorously
 derived description of correlated post-Newtonian dynamics
 in the diffusion limit. We argue that general maximal
 entropy considerations strongly constrain the orbital
 diffusion in steady state, irrespective of the relaxation
 mechanism. We identify the exact phase-space separatrix
 between plunges and inspirals, and predict their
 steady-state rates. We derive the dependence of the rates
 on the mass of the MBH, show that the contribution of RR in
 steady state is small, and discuss special cases where
 unquenched RR in restricted volumes of phase-space may
 affect the steady state substantially.},

  abstract      = {In nuclear star clusters, the potential is governed by the central massive black hole (MBH), so that stars move on nearly Keplerian orbits and the total potential is almost stationary in time. Yet, the deviations of the potential from the Keplerian one, due to the enclosed stellar mass and general relativity, will cause the stellar orbits to precess. Moreover, as a result of the finite number of stars, small deviations of the potential from spherical symmetry induce residual torques that can change the stars? angular momentum faster than the standard two-body relaxation. The combination of these two effects drives a stochastic evolution of orbital angular momentum, a process named ?resonant relaxation? (RR). Owing to recent developments in the description of the relaxation of self-gravitating systems, we can now fully describe scalar resonant relaxation (relaxation of the magnitude of the angular momentum) as a diffusion process. In this framework, the potential fluctuations due to the complex orbital motion of the stars are described by a random correlated noise with statistical properties that are fully characterized by the stars? mean field motion. On long timescales, the cluster can be regarded as a diffusive system with diffusion coefficients that depend explicitly on the mean field stellar distribution through the properties of the noise. We show here, for the first time, how the diffusion coefficients of scalar RR, for a spherically symmetric system, can be fully calculated from first principles, without any free parameters. We also provide an open source code that evaluates these diffusion coefficients numerically.},

  Abstract                 = {The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory
 (LIGO) found direct evidence for double black hole binaries
 emitting gravitational waves. Galactic nuclei are expected
 to harbor the densest population of stellar-mass black
 holes. A significant fraction (Ëœ 30 \% ) of these black
 holes can reside in binaries. We examine the fate of the
 black hole binaries in active galactic nuclei, which get
 trapped in the inner region of the accretion disk around
 the central supermassive black hole. We show that binary
 black holes can migrate into and then rapidly merge within
 the disk well within a Salpeter time. The binaries may also
 accrete a significant amount of gas from the disk, well
 above the Eddington rate. This could lead to detectable
 X-ray or gamma-ray emission, but would require
 hyper-Eddington accretion with a few percent radiative
 efficiency, comparable to thin disks. We discuss
 implications for gravitational-wave observations and black
 hole population studies. We estimate that Advanced LIGO may
 detect Ëœ20 such gas-induced binary mergers per year.},

 Galaxy with 30-arcsec resolution made simultaneously at 30
 microns, 50 microns, and 100 microns are presented. The
 30-micron radiation peaks strongly at the position of the
 galactic center, as determined from the 2-micron surface
 brightness and the density of ionized gas. The 50- and
 100-micron emission is much more extended along the plane
 and shows two emission lobes, one on either side of the
 30-micron peak. At the position of the galactic center
 itself there is a local minimum in the 100-micron surface
 brightness. It is concluded that the dust density decreases
 inward over the central few parsecs of the Galaxy and that
 the dust density in the central parsec is so low that
 optical and ultraviolet radiation freely traverses this
 region. The total luminosity of the sources heating the
 dust which radiates the far-infrared emission from the
 central few parsecs is deduced to be between 1 x 10 to the
 7th and 3 x 10 to the 7th solar luminosities.},

  Abstract                 = {The steady flow of a uniform nonrelativistic gas, in which radiation pressure swamps thermal pressure at infinity, is studied in terms of the dynamics of an in-falling gas into a black hole. It is shown that the actual accretion rate depends on the optical depth of a column of unperturbed gas spanning the Bondi radius. Radiation leaks out of the gas as it moves toward the trans-sonic point, and the sound speed decreases inwards in the subsonic region. Thus, the density must increase sharply to maintain pressure. It is suggested that if a super-massive (500,000 solar masses) star is swallowed by a black hole, it will not have time to ignite its nuclear fuel and blow itself apart, and will add substantially to the mass of the hole.},

  Abstract                 = {Galactic globular clusters are old, dense star systems
 typically containing 104-106 stars. As an old population of
 stars, globular clusters contain many collapsed and
 degenerate objects. As a dense population of stars,
 globular clusters are the scene of many interesting close
 dynamical interactions between stars. These dynamical
 interactions can alter the evolution of individual stars
 and can produce tight binary systems containing one or two
 compact objects. In this review, we discuss theoretical
 models of globular cluster evolution and binary evolution,
 techniques for simulating this evolution that leads to
 relativistic binaries, and current and possible future
 observational evidence for this population. Our discussion
 of globular cluster evolution will focus on the processes
 that boost the production of tight binary systems and the
 subsequent interaction of these binaries that can alter the
 properties of both bodies and can lead to exotic objects.
 Direct N-body integrations and Fokker-Planck simulations of
 the evolution of globular clusters that incorporate tidal
 interactions and lead to predictions of relativistic binary
 populations are also discussed. We discuss the current
 observational evidence for cataclysmic variables,
 millisecond pulsars, and low-mass X-ray binaries as well as
 possible future detection of relativistic binaries with
 gravitational radiation.},

 separated into two classes. Objects having peaked isophotes
 (indicating weak disk components) are in general consistent
 with being rotationally flattened, suggesting that these
 objects are similar to S0 galaxies. In contrast, elliptical
 galaxies with box-shaped isophotes frequently owe their
 shape to anisotropies in their velocity dispersion and most

  Abstract                 = {Reverberation mapping is now a well-established technique
 for investigating spatially-unresolved structures in the
 nuclei of distant galaxies with actively-accreting
 supermassive black holes. Structural parameters for the
 broad emission-line region, with angular sizes of
 microarcseconds, can be constrained through the
 substitution of time resolution for spatial resolution.
 Many reverberation experiments over the last 30 years have
 led to a practical understanding of the requirements
 necessary for a successful program. With reverberation
 measurements now in hand for 60 active galaxies, and more
 on the horizon, we are able to directly constrain black
 hole masses, derive scaling relationships that allow large
 numbers of black hole mass estimates throughout the
 observable Universe, and begin investigating the detailed
 geometry and kinematics of the broad line region.
 Reverberation mapping is therefore one of the few
 techniques available that will allow a deeper understanding
 of the physical mechanisms involved in AGN feeding and
 feedback at very small scales, as well as constraints on
 the growth and evolution of black holes across cosmic time.
 In this contribution, I will briefly review the background,
 implementation, and major results derived from this high
 angular resolution technique.},

 galaxy mergers, but their long-term evolution is uncertain.
 In spherical galaxies, N-body simulations show that binary
 evolution stalls at separations much too large for
 significant emission of gravitational waves (the
 ``final-parsec problem''). Here we follow the long-term
 evolution of a massive binary in more realistic, triaxial
 and rotating galaxy models with particle numbers as high as
 106. We find that the binary does not stall. The binary
 hardening rates that we observe are sufficient to allow
 complete coalescence of binary SBHs in 10 Gyr or less, even
 in the absence of collisional loss-cone refilling or
 gasdynamical torques, thus providing a potential solution
 to the final-parsec problem.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper studies the formation and evolution of binary
 supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in rotating galactic
 nuclei, focusing on the role of stellar dynamics. We
 present the first N-body simulations that follow the
 evolution of the SMBHs from kiloparsec separations all the
 way to their final relativistic coalescence, and that can
 robustly be scaled to real galaxies. The N-body code
 includes post-Newtonian (P N) corrections to the binary
 equations of motion up to order 2.5; we show that the
 evolution of the massive binary is only correctly
 reproduced if the conservative 1 P N and 2 P N terms are
 included. The orbital eccentricities of the massive
 binaries in our simulations are often found to remain large
 until shortly before coalescence. This directly affects not
 only their orbital evolution rates, but has important
 consequences as well for the gravitational waveforms
 emitted during the relativistic inspiral. We estimate
 gravitational wave amplitudes when the frequencies fall
 inside the band of the (planned) Laser Interferometer Space
 Antennae (LISA). We find significant contributions---well
 above the LISA sensitivity curve---from the higher-order
 harmonics.},

  Abstract                 = {We present continued radio observations of the tidal
 disruption event Swift J164449.3+573451 extending to deltat
 â‰ˆ 216 days after discovery. The data were obtained with
 the EVLA, AMI Large Array, CARMA, the SMA, and the
 VLBA+Effelsberg as part of a long-term program to monitor
 the expansion and energy scale of the relativistic outflow,
 and to trace the parsec-scale environment around a
 previously dormant supermassive black hole (SMBH). The new
 observations reveal a significant change in the radio
 evolution starting at deltat â‰ˆ 1 month, with a
 brightening at all frequencies that requires an increase in
 the energy by about an order of magnitude, and an overall
 density profile around the SMBH of rhovpropr -3/2 (0.1-1.2
 pc) with a significant flattening at r â‰ˆ 0.4-0.6 pc. The
 increase in energy cannot be explained with continuous
 injection from an Lvpropt -5/3 tail, which is observed in
 the X-rays. Instead, we conclude that the relativistic jet
 was launched with a wide range of Lorentz factors, obeying
 E(> Gamma j )vpropGamma-2.5 j . The similar ratios of
 duration to dynamical timescale for Sw 1644+57 and
 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) suggest that this result may be
 applicable to GRB jets as well. The radial density profile
 may be indicative of Bondi accretion, with the inferred
 flattening at r ~ 0.5 pc in good agreement with the Bondi
 radius for a ~few Ã— 106 M &sun; black hole. The density at
 ~0.5 pc is about a factor of 30 times lower than inferred
 for the Milky Way Galactic Center, potentially due to a
 smaller number of mass-shedding massive stars. From our
 latest observations (deltat â‰ˆ 216 days) we find that the
 jet energy is E j, iso â‰ˆ 5 Ã— 1053 erg (Ej â‰ˆ 2.4 Ã—
 1051 erg for theta j = 0.1), the radius is r â‰ˆ 1.2 pc,
 the Lorentz factor is Gamma j â‰ˆ 2.2, the ambient density
 is n â‰ˆ 0.2 cm-3, and the projected angular size is r proj
 â‰ˆ 25 muas, below the resolution of the VLBA+Effelsberg.
 Assuming no future changes in the observed evolution and a
 final integrated total energy of Ej â‰ˆ 1052 erg, we
 predict that the radio emission from Sw 1644+57 should be
 detectable with the EVLA for several decades and will be
 resolvable with very long baseline interferometry in a few
 years.},

 disk models with non-LTE atmospheres to near simultaneous
 multiwavelength data of 3C\~{}273, extending from the
 optical to the far ultraviolet. Our model fits show no flux
 discontinuity associated with a hydrogen Lyman edge, but
 they do exhibit a spectral break which qualitatively
 resembles that seen in the data. This break arises from
 relativistic smearing of Lyman emission edges which are
 produced locally at tens of gravitational radii in the
 disk. We discuss the possible effects of metal line
 blanketing on the model spectra, as well as the substantial
 Comptonization required to explain the observed soft X-ray
 excess. Our best fit accretion disk model underpredicts the
 near ultraviolet emission in this source, and also has an
 optical spectrum which is too red. We discuss some of the
 remaining physical uncertainties, and suggest in particular
 that an extension of our models to the slim disk regime
 and/or including nonzero magnetic torques across the
 innermost stable circular orbit may help resolve these
 discrepancies.},

  Abstract                 = {We present new, more precise measurements of the mass and
 distance of our Galaxy?s central supermassive black hole,
 Sgr A*. These results stem from a new analysis that more
 than doubles the time baseline for astrometry of faint
 stars orbiting Sgr A*, combining 2 decades of speckle
 imaging and adaptive optics data. Specifically, we improve
 our analysis of the speckle images by using information
 about a star?s orbit from the deep adaptive optics data
 (2005-2013) to inform the search for the star in the
 speckle years (1995-2005). When this new analysis technique
 is combined with the first complete re-reduction of Keck
 Galactic Center speckle images using speckle holography, we
 are able to track the short-period star S0-38 (K-band
 magnitude = 17, orbital period = 19 yr) through the speckle
 years. We use the kinematic measurements from speckle
 holography and adaptive optics to estimate the orbits of
 S0-38 and S0-2 and thereby improve our constraints of the
 mass (M bh) and distance (R o ) of Sgr A*: M bh = (4.02 ?
 0.16 ? 0.04) ?106 M ? and 7.86 ? 0.14 ? 0.04 kpc. The
 uncertainties in M bh and R o as determined by the combined
 orbital fit of S0-2 and S0-38 are improved by a factor of 2
 and 2.5, respectively, compared to an orbital fit of S0-2
 alone and a factor of ?2.5 compared to previous results
 from stellar orbits. This analysis also limits the extended
 dark mass within 0.01 pc to less than 0.13 ?106 M ? at
 99.7% confidence, a factor of 3 lower compared to prior
 work.},

  Abstract                 = {The potential of tidal disruption of stars to probe otherwise quiescent supermassive black holes cannot be exploited, if their dynamics is not fully understood. So far, the observational appearance of these events has been derived from analytical extrapolations of the debris dynamical properties just after disruption. By means of hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the subsequent fallback of the stream of debris towards the black hole for stars already bound to the black hole on eccentric orbits. We demonstrate that the debris circularize due to relativistic apsidal precession which causes the stream to self-cross. The circularization time-scale varies between 1 and 10 times the period of the star, being shorter for more eccentric and/or deeper encounters. This self-crossing leads to the formation of shocks that increase the thermal energy of the debris. If this thermal energy is efficiently radiated away, the debris settle in a narrow ring at the circularization radius with shock-induced luminosities of ?10-103 LEdd. If instead cooling is impeded, the debris form an extended torus located between the circularization radius and the semi-major axis of the star with heating rates ?1-102 LEdd. Extrapolating our results to parabolic orbits, we infer that circularization would occur via the same mechanism in ?1 period of the most bound debris for deeply penetrating encounters to ?10 for grazing ones. We also anticipate the same effect of the cooling efficiency on the structure of the disc with associated luminosities of ?1-10 LEdd and heating rates of ?0.1-1 LEdd. In the latter case of inefficient cooling, we deduce a viscous time-scale generally shorter than the circularization time-scale. This suggests an accretion rate through the disc tracing the fallback rate, if viscosity starts acting promptly.},

  Abstract                 = {We report the discovery of a transient radio source 2.7" (0.1 pc projected distance) south of the Galactic center massive black hole, Sgr A*. The source flared with a peak of at least 80 mJy in 2004 March. The source was resolved by the Very Large Array into two components with a separation of ~0.7" and characteristic sizes of ~0.2". The two components of the source faded with a power-law index of 1.1+/-0.1. We detect an upper limit to the proper motion of the eastern component of ~3×103 km s-1 relative to Sgr A*. We detect a proper motion of ~104 km s-1 for the western component relative to Sgr A*. The transient was also detected at X-ray wavelengths with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and XMM-Newton and given the designation CXOGC J174540.0-290031. The X-ray source falls in between the two radio components. The maximum luminosity of the X-ray source is ~1036 ergs s-1, significantly sub-Eddington. The radio jet flux density predicted by the X-ray/radio correlation for X-ray binaries is orders of magnitude less than the measured flux density. We conclude that the radio transient is the result of a bipolar jet originating in a single impulsive event from the X-ray source and interacting with the dense interstellar medium of the Galactic center.},

 astrophysical MHD and turbulence simulations are
 highlighted. A number of one-dimensional test cases are
 presented ranging from various shock tests to Parker-type
 wind solutions. Applications to magnetized accretion discs
 and their associated outflows are discussed. Particular
 emphasis is placed on the possibility of dynamo action in
 three-dimensional turbulent convection and shear flows,
 which is relevant to stars and astrophysical discs. The
 generation of large scale fields is discussed in terms of
 an inverse magnetic cascade and the consequences imposed by
 magnetic helicity conservation are reviewed with particular
 emphasis on the issue of alpha-quenching.},

  Abstract                 = {The Fermi satellite has recently detected gamma-ray
 emission from the central regions of our Galaxy. This may
 be evidence for dark matter particles, a major component of
 the standard cosmological model, annihilating to produce
 high-energy photons. We show that the observed signal may
 instead be generated by millisecond pulsars that formed in
 dense star clusters in the Galactic halo. Most of these
 clusters were ultimately disrupted by evaporation and
 gravitational tides, contributing to a spherical bulge of
 stars and stellar remnants. The gamma-ray amplitude,
 angular distribution, and spectral signatures of this
 source may be predicted without free parameters, and are in
 remarkable agreement with the observations. These
 gamma-rays are from fossil remains of dispersed clusters,
 telling the history of the Galactic bulge.},

  Abstract                 = {Relativistic jets are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems
 that contain compact objects. They transport large amounts
 of energy to large distances from the source and their
 interaction with the ambient medium has a crucial effect on
 the evolution of the system. The propagation of the jet is
 characterized by the formation of a shocked "head" at the
 front of the jet which dissipates the jet's energy and a
 cocoon that surrounds the jet and potentially collimates
 it. We present here a self-consistent, analytic model that
 follows the evolution of the jet and its cocoon, and
 describes their interaction. We show that the critical
 parameter that determines the properties of the jet-cocoon
 system is the dimensionless ratio between the jet's energy
 density and the rest-mass energy density of the ambient
 medium. This parameter, together with the jet's injection
 angle, also determines whether the jet is collimated by the
 cocoon or not. The model is applicable to relativistic,
 unmagnetized jets on all scales and may be used to
 determine the conditions in active galactic nucleus (AGN)
 jets as well as in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) or microquasars.
 It shows that AGN and microquasar jets are hydrodynamically
 collimated due to the interaction with the ambient medium,
 while GRB jets can be collimated only inside a star and
 become uncollimated once they break out.},

  Abstract                 = {We present observations of Swift J1112.2-8238, and
 identify it as a candidate relativistic tidal disruption
 flare. The outburst was first detected by Swift/Burst Alert
 Telescope (BAT) in 2011 June as an unknown, long-lived
 (order of days) gamma-ray transient source. We show that
 its position is consistent with the nucleus of a faint
 galaxy for which we establish a likely redshift of z = 0.89
 based on a single emission line that we interpret as the
 blended [O II] lambda3727 doublet. At this redshift, the
 peak X-ray/gamma-ray luminosity exceeded 1047 erg s-1,
 while a spatially coincident optical transient source had
 i' Ëœ 22 (Mg Ëœ -21.4 at z = 0.89) during early
 observations, Ëœ20 d after the Swift trigger. These
 properties place Swift J1112.2-8238 in a very similar
 region of parameter space to the two previously identified
 members of this class, Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+0516.
 As with those events the high-energy emission shows
 evidence for variability over the first few days, while
 late-time observations, almost 3 yr post-outburst,
 demonstrate that it has now switched off. Swift
 J1112.2-8238 brings the total number of such events
 observed by Swift to three, interestingly all detected by
 Swift over a Ëœ3 month period (<3 per cent of its total
 lifetime as of 2015 March). While this suggests the
 possibility that further examples may be uncovered by
 detailed searches of the BAT archives, the lack of any
 prime candidates in the years since 2011 means these events
 are undoubtedly rare.},

  Abstract                 = {We use an extensive suite of numerical simulations to
 constrain the mass and orbit of Planet Nine, the recently
 proposed perturber in a distant eccentric orbit in the
 outer solar system. We compare our simulations to the
 observed population of aligned eccentric high semimajor
 axis Kuiper belt objects and determine which simulation
 parameters are statistically compatible with the
 observations. We find that only a narrow range of orbital
 elements can reproduce the observations. In particular, the
 combination of semimajor axis, eccentricity, and mass of
 Planet Nine strongly dictates the semimajor axis range of
 the orbital confinement of the distant eccentric Kuiper
 belt objects. Allowed orbits, which confine Kuiper belt
 objects with semimajor axis beyond 230 AU, have perihelia
 roughly between 200 and 350 AU, semimajor axes between 300
 and 900 AU, and masses of approximately 10 Earth masses.
 Orbitally confined objects also generally have orbital
 planes similar to that of the planet, suggesting that the
 planet is inclined approximately 30 degrees to the
 ecliptic. We compare the allowed orbital positions and
 estimated brightness of Planet Nine to previous and ongoing
 surveys which would be sensitive to the planet's detection
 and use these surveys to rule out approximately two-thirds
 of the planet's orbit. Planet Nine is likely near aphelion
 with an approximate brightness of $22<V<25$. At opposition,
 its motion, mainly due to parallax, can easily be detected
 within 24 hours.},

  Abstract                 = {Context: The GC is the closest galactic nucleus, offering
 the unique possibility of studying the population of a
 dense stellar cluster surrounding an SMBH. Aims: The goals
 of this work are to develop a new method of separating
 early and late type stellar components of a dense stellar
 cluster based on narrow band filters, applying it to the
 central parsec of the GC, and conducting a population
 analysis of this area. Methods: We use AO assisted
 observations obtained at the ESO VLT in the NIR H-band and
 7 intermediate bands covering the NIR K-band. A comparison
 of the resulting SEDs with a blackbody of variable
 extinction then allows us to determine the presence and
 strength of a CO absorption feature to distinguish between
 early and late type stars. Results: This new method is
 suitable for classifying K giants (and later), as well as
 B2 main sequence (and earlier) stars that are brighter than
 15.5 mag in the K band in the central parsec. Compared to
 previous spectroscopic investigations that are limited to
 13-14 mag, this represents a major improvement in the depth
 of the observations and reduces the needed observation
 time. Extremely red objects and foreground sources can also
 be reliably removed from the sample. Comparison to sources
 of known classification indicates that the method has an
 accuracy of better than ~87%. We classify 312 stars as
 early type candidates out of a sample of 5914 sources.
 Several results, such as the shape of the KLF and the
 spatial distribution of both early and late type stars,
 confirm and extend previous works. The distribution of the
 early type stars can be fitted with a steep power law
 (beta1'' = -1.49 $\pm$ 0.12), alternatively with a broken
 power law, beta1-10'' = -1.08 $\pm$ 0.12, beta10-20'' =
 -3.46 $\pm$ 0.58, since we find a drop in the early type
 density at ~10''. We also detect early type candidates
 outside of 0.5 pc in significant numbers for the first
 time. The late type density function shows an inversion in
 the inner 6'', with a power-law slope of betaR<6'' = 0.17
 $\pm$ 0.09. The late type KLF has a power-law slope of 0.30
 $\pm$ 0.01, closely resembling the KLF obtained for the
 bulge of the Milky Way. The early type KLF has a much
 flatter slope of (0.14 $\pm$ 0.02). Our results agree best
 with an in-situ star formation scenario. A table of all
 classified sources (5914) is only available in electronic

  Abstract                 = {We present a versatile family of model galactic outflows
 including non-uniform mass and energy source distributions,
 a gravitational potential from an extended mass source, and
 radiative losses. The model easily produces steady-state
 wind solutions for a range of mass-loading factors,
 energy-loading factors, galaxy mass, and galaxy radius. We
 find that, with radiative losses included, highly
 mass-loaded winds must be driven at high central
 temperatures, whereas low mass-loaded winds can be driven
 at low temperatures just above the peak of the cooling
 curve, meaning radiative losses can drastically affect the
 wind solution even for low mass-loading factors. By
 including radiative losses, we are able to show that
 subsonic flows can be ignored as a possible mechanism for
 expelling mass and energy from a galaxy compared to the
 more efficient transonic solutions. Specifically, the
 transonic solutions with low mass loading and high energy
 loading are the most efficient. Our model also produces
 low-temperature, high-velocity winds that could explain the
 prevalence of low-temperature material in observed
 outflows. Finally, we show that our model, unlike the
 well-known Chevalier & Clegg model, can reproduce the
 observed linear relationship between wind X-ray luminosity
 and star formation rate (SFR) over a large range of SFR
 from 1-1000 M&sun; yr-1 assuming the wind mass-loading
 factor is higher for low-mass, and hence, low-SFR galaxies.
 We also constrain the allowed mass-loading factors that can
 fit the observed X-ray luminosity versus SFR trend, further
 suggesting an inverse relationship between mass loading and
 SFR as explored in advanced numerical simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {We obtained Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3
 imaging of a sample of ten of the nearest and brightest
 nuclear clusters (NCs) residing in late-type spiral
 galaxies, in seven bands that span the near-UV to the
 near-IR. Structural properties of the clusters were
 measured by fitting two-dimensional surface brightness
 profiles to the images using GALFIT. The clusters exhibit a
 wide range of structural properties, with F814W absolute
 magnitudes that range from -11.2 to -15.1 mag and F814W
 effective radii that range from 1.4 to 8.3 pc. For 6 of the
 10 clusters in our sample, we find changes in the effective
 radius with wavelength, suggesting radially varying stellar
 populations. In four of the objects, the effective radius
 increases with wavelength, indicating the presence of a
 younger population that is more concentrated than the bulk
 of the stars in the cluster. However, we find a general
 decrease in effective radius with wavelength in two of the
 objects in our sample, which may indicate extended,
 circumnuclear star formation. We also find a general trend
 of increasing roundness of the clusters at longer
 wavelengths, as well as a correlation between the axis
 ratios of the NCs and their host galaxies. These
 observations indicate that blue disks aligned with the host
 galaxy plane are a common feature of NCs in late-type
 galaxies, but are difficult to detect in galaxies that are
 close to face-on. In color--color diagrams spanning the
 near-UV through the near-IR, most of the clusters lie far
 from single-burst evolutionary tracks, showing evidence for
 multi-age populations. Most of the clusters have integrated
 colors consistent with a mix of an old population (>1 Gyr)
 and a young population (~100--300 Myr). The wide wavelength
 coverage of our data provides a sensitivity to populations
 with a mix of ages that would not be possible to achieve
 with imaging in optical bands only. The surface brightness
 profiles presented in this work will be used for future
 stellar population modeling and dynamical studies of the
 clusters. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA
 Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope
 Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of
 Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA
 contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated

 penetrating well inside the Roche radius will undergo
 compression to a short-lived pancake configuration very
 similar to that produced by a high velocity symmetric
 collision of the kind likely to occur in the neighborhood
 of black holes in the higher mass range greater than about
 10 to the 9th solar masses. Thermonuclear energy release
 ensuing in the more extreme events may be sufficient to
 modify substantially the working of the entire accretion

  Abstract                 = {We report the discovery by the Swift hard X-ray monitor of
 the transient source Swift J2058.4+0516 (Sw J2058+05). Our
 multi-wavelength follow-up campaign uncovered a long-lived
 (duration >~ months), luminous X-ray (L X, iso â‰ˆ 3 Ã—
 1047 erg s-1) and radio (nuL nu, iso â‰ˆ 1042 erg s-1)
 counterpart. The associated optical emission, however, from
 which we measure a redshift of 1.1853, is relatively faint,
 and this is not due to a large amount of dust extinction in
 the host galaxy. Based on numerous similarities with the
 recently discovered GRB 110328A/Swift J164449.3+573451 (Sw
 J1644+57), we suggest that Sw J2058+05 may be the second
 member of a new class of relativistic outbursts resulting
 from the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black
 hole. If so, the relative rarity of these sources (compared
 with the expected rate of tidal disruptions) implies that
 either these outflows are extremely narrowly collimated
 (theta < 1$\,^{\circ}$) or only a small fraction of tidal
 disruptions generate relativistic ejecta. Analogous to the
 case of long-duration gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse
 supernovae, we speculate that rapid spin of the black hole
 may be a necessary condition to generate the relativistic
 component. Alternatively, if powered by gas accretion
 (i.e., an active galactic nucleus (AGN)), Sw J2058+05 would
 seem to represent a new mode of variability in these
 sources, as the observed properties appear largely
 inconsistent with known classes of AGNs capable of
 generating relativistic jets (blazars, narrow-line Seyfert
 1 galaxies).},

 aperture velocity dispersions and newly derived luminosity

 profiles and empirical properties and relations of galaxy
 and halo parameters. When two-component (i.e. stellar plus
 dark) mass models are fitted to the SDSS aperture velocity
 dispersions, the predicted velocity dispersion profile (VP)
 slopes within the effective (i.e. projected half-light)
 radius Reff match well the distribution in observed
 elliptical galaxies. From a number of input variations the
 models exhibit for the radial range 0.1Reff < r < Reff a
 tight correlation <gammae> = (1.865 $\pm$ 0.008) + (-4.93
 $\pm$ 0.15)<eta> where <gammae> is the mean slope absolute
 value of the total mass density and <eta> is the mean slope
 of the velocity dispersion profile, which leads to a
 super-isothermal <gammae> = 2.15 $\pm$ 0.04 for <eta> =
 -0.058 $\pm$ 0.008 in observed elliptical galaxies.
 Furthermore, the successful two-component models appear to
 imply a typical slope curvature pattern in the total mass
 profile because for the observed steep luminosity (stellar
 mass) profile and the weak lensing inferred halo profile at
 large radii a total mass profile with monotonically varying
 slope would require too high dark matter density in the
 optical region giving rise to too large aperture velocity
 dispersion and too shallow VP.},

  Abstract                 = {Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) at sub-parsec
 separations should be common in galactic nuclei, as a
 result of frequent galaxy mergers. Hydrodynamical
 simulations of circum-binary discs predict strong periodic
 modulation of the mass accretion rate on time-scales
 comparable to the orbital period of the binary. As a
 result, SMBHBs may be recognized by the periodic modulation
 of their brightness. We conducted a statistical search for
 periodic variability in a sample of 35 383
 spectroscopically confirmed quasars in the photometric data
 base of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). We analysed
 Lomb-Scargle periodograms and assessed the significance of
 our findings by modelling each individual quasar's
 variability as a damped random walk (DRW). We identified 50
 quasars with significant periodicity beyond the DRW model,
 typically with short periods of a few hundred days. We find
 33 of these to remain significant after a re-analysis of
 their periodograms including additional optical data from
 the intermediate-PTF and the Catalina Real-Time Transient
 Survey. Assuming that the observed periods correspond to
 the redshifted orbital periods of SMBHBs, we conclude that
 our findings are consistent with a population of
 unequal-mass SMBHBs, with a typical mass ratio as low as q

  Abstract                 = {We have studied three-dimensional hydrodynamic
 interactions of relativistic extragalactic jets with
 two-phase ambient media. These jets propagate through a
 denser homogeneous gas and then impact clouds with
 densities 100 to 1000 times higher than the initial beam
 density. The deflection angle of the jet is influenced more
 by the density contrast of the cloud than by the beam Mach
 number of the jet. A relativistic jet with low relativistic
 beam Mach number can eventually be slightly bent after it
 crosses the dense cloud; however, we have not seen
 permanently bent structures in the interaction of a high
 relativistic beam Mach number jet with a cloud. The
 relativistic jet impacts on dense clouds do not necessarily
 destroy the clouds completely, and much of the cloud body
 can survive as a coherent blob. This enhancement of cloud
 durability is partly due to the geometric influence of the
 off-axis collisions we consider and also arises from the
 lower rate of cloud fragmentation through the
 Kelvin-Helmholtz instability for relativistic jets. To
 compare our simulations with observed extragalactic radio
 jets, we have computed the approximate surface
 distributions of synchrotron emission at different viewing
 angles. These surface intensity maps show that relativistic
 jets interacting with clouds can produce synchrotron
 emission knots similar to structures observed in many
 VLBI-scale radio sources. We find that the synchrotron
 emission increases steeply at the moment of impact and the
 emission peaks right before the jet passes through the
 cloud.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the Pan-STARRS1 discovery of the long-lived and
 blue transient PS1-11af, which was also detected by Galaxy
 Evolution Explorer with coordinated observations in the
 near-ultraviolet (NUV) band. PS1-11af is associated with
 the nucleus of an early type galaxy at redshift z = 0.4046
 that exhibits no evidence for star formation or active
 galactic nucleus activity. Four epochs of spectroscopy
 reveal a pair of transient broad absorption features in the
 UV on otherwise featureless spectra. Despite the
 superficial similarity of these features to P-Cygni
 absorptions of supernovae (SNe), we conclude that PS1-11af
 is not consistent with the properties of known types of
 SNe. Blackbody fits to the spectral energy distribution are
 inconsistent with the cooling, expanding ejecta of a SN,
 and the velocities of the absorption features are too high
 to represent material in homologous expansion near a SN
 photosphere. However, the constant blue colors and slow
 evolution of the luminosity are similar to previous
 optically selected tidal disruption events (TDEs). The
 shape of the optical light curve is consistent with models
 for TDEs, but the minimum accreted mass necessary to power
 the observed luminosity is only ~0.002 M &sun;, which
 points to a partial disruption model. A full disruption
 model predicts higher bolometric luminosities, which would
 require most of the radiation to be emitted in a separate
 component at high energies where we lack observations. In
 addition, the observed temperature is lower than that
 predicted by pure accretion disk models for TDEs and
 requires reprocessing to a constant, lower temperature.
 Three deep non-detections in the radio with the Very Large
 Array over the first two years after the event set strict
 limits on the production of any relativistic outflow
 comparable to Swift J1644+57, even if off-axis.},

 black holes at the centers of elliptical galaxies affects
 the hot ISM of these systems with the aid of a
 high-resolution hydrodynamical code, where the cooling and

 self-regulated coevolution of massive BHs and their host
 galaxies, and (1) the mass accumulated by the central BH is
 limited by feedback to the range observed today and (2)
 relaxation instabilities occur so that duty cycles are
 small enough (<~0.03) to account for the very small
 fraction of massive ellipticals observed to be in the
 ``on'' QSO phase, when the accretion luminosity approaches
 the Eddington luminosity. The duty cycle of the hot bubbles
 inflated at the galactic center during major accretion
 episodes is of the order of >~0.1-0.4. Major accretion
 episodes caused by cooling flows in the recycled gas
 produced by normal stellar evolution trigger nuclear
 starbursts coincident with AGN flaring. Overall, in the
 bursting phase (1<~z<~3), the duty cycle of the BH in its
 ``on'' phase is of the order of percents and is unobscured
 approximately one-third of the time, the obscuration
 occurring during dusty starbursts. Roughly half of the
 recycled gas from dying stars is ejected as galactic winds,
 half is consumed in central starbursts, and less than 1% is
 accreted onto the central BH. Mechanical energy output from
 nonrelativistic gas winds integrates to 2.3Ã—1059 ergs,
 with most of it caused by broad-line AGN outflows. We
 predict the typical properties of the very metal-rich
 poststarburst central regions and show that the resulting
 surface density profiles are well described by S{\'e}rsic

 the z = 0.1569 galaxy SDSS J171544.05+600835.7. The galaxy
 was initially identified as a dual active galactic nucleus
 (AGN) candidate based on the double-peaked [O III]
 $\lambda$5007 emission lines, with a line-of-sight velocity
 separation of 350 km s-1, in its Sloan Digital Sky Survey
 spectrum. We used the Kast Spectrograph at Lick Observatory
 to obtain two long-slit spectra of the galaxy at two
 different position angles, which reveal that the two Type 2
 AGN emission components have not only a velocity offset,
 but also a projected spatial offset of 1.9 h -1 70 kpc on
 the sky. Chandra/ACIS observations of two X-ray sources
 with the same spatial offset and orientation as the optical
 emission suggest that the galaxy most likely contains
 Compton-thick dual AGNs, although the observations could
 also be explained by AGN jets. Deeper X-ray observations
 that reveal Fe K lines, if present, would distinguish
 between the two scenarios. The observations of a double
 X-ray source in SDSS J171544.05+600835.7 are a proof of
 concept for a new, systematic detection method that selects
 promising dual AGN candidates from ground-based
 spectroscopy that exhibits both velocity and spatial
 offsets in the AGN emission features.},

  Abstract                 = {We revisit a core prediction of the disc instability model
 (DIM) applied to X-ray binaries. The model predicts the
 existence of a critical mass-transfer rate, which depends
 on disc size, separating transient and persistent systems.
 We therefore selected a sample of 52 persistent and
 transient neutron star and black hole X-ray binaries and
 verified if the observed persistent (transient) systems do
 lie in the appropriate stable (unstable) region of
 parameter space predicted by the model. We find that,
 despite the significant uncertainties inherent to these
 kinds of studies, the data are in very good agreement with
 the theoretical expectations. We then discuss some
 individual cases that do not clearly fit into this main
 conclusion. Finally, we introduce the transientness
 parameter as a measure of the activity of a source and show
 a clear trend of the average outburst recurrence time to
 decrease with transientness in agreement with the DIM
 predictions. We therefore conclude that, despite
 difficulties in reproducing the complex details of the
 light curves, the DIM succeeds in explaining the global
 behaviour of X-ray binaries averaged over a long enough
 period of time.},

  Abstract                 = {Finding electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of future
 gravitational wave (GW) sources would bring rich scientific
 benefits. A promising possibility, in the case of the
 coalescence of a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB), is
 that the prompt emission from merger-induced disturbances
 in a supersonic circumbinary disc may be detectable. We
 follow the post-merger evolution of a thin, zero-viscosity
 circumbinary gas disc with two-dimensional simulations,
 using the hydrodynamic code FLASH. We analyse perturbations
 arising from the 530 km s-1 recoil of a 106Msolar binary,
 oriented in the plane of the disc, assuming either a
 non-radiative gamma-law or a pseudo-isothermal equation of
 state for the gas. We find that a single-armed spiral shock
 wave forms and propagates outwards, sweeping up \~{}40 per
 cent of the mass of the disc. The morphology and evolution
 of the perturbations agrees well with those of caustics
 predicted to occur in a collisionless disc. Assuming that
 the disc radiates nearly instantaneously to maintain a
 constant temperature, we estimate the amount of dissipation
 and corresponding post-merger light curve. The luminosity
 rises steadily on the time-scale of months, and reaches few
 âˆš\'{o}1043 ergs-1, corresponding to \~{}10 per cent of
 the Eddington luminosity of the central SMBHB. We also
 analyse the case in which gravitational wave emission
 results in a 5 per cent mass loss in the merger remnant.
 The mass loss reduces the shock overdensities and the
 overall luminosity of the disc by \~{}15-20 per cent,
 without any other major effects on the spiral shock pattern.},

  Abstract                 = {Aims: During the last ~50 years, the population of black
 hole candidates in X-ray binaries has increased
 considerably, with 59 Galactic objects being detected in
 transient low-mass X-ray binaries, as well as a few in
 persistent systems (including ~5 extragalactic binaries).
 Methods: We collect near-infrared, optical, and X-ray
 information spread over hundreds of references to study the
 population of black holes in X-ray transients as a whole.
 Results: We present the most updated catalogue of black
 hole transients. This contains X-ray, optical, and
 near-infrared observations, together with their astrometric
 and dynamical properties. The catalogue provides new and
 useful information in both statistical and observational
 parameters and provides a thorough and complete overview of
 the black hole population in the Milky Way. Analysing the
 distances and spatial distribution of the observed systems,
 we estimate a total population of ~1300 Galactic black hole
 transients. This means that we have only discovered less
 than ~5% of the total Galactic distribution. The complete
 version of this catalogue will be continuously updated at
 http://www.astro.puc.cl/BlackCAT and in the Virtual
 Observatory, including finding charts and data in other
 wavelengths.Tables A.1 to A.4 are also available in

The distribution of these bursts is isotropic across the sky, but inhomogeneous in space, with a deficit of faint bursts. It is currently unknown whether ?-ray bursts are produced in our Galaxy or at cosmological distances. The detection and identification of counterparts at other wavelengths are seen as crucial for resolving the origin of the events. Here we report the detection by the Beppo-SAX satellite of an X-ray `afterglow', associated with the ?-ray burst of 28 February 1997 (GRB970228; ref. 3)-the first such detection for any ?-ray burst. The X-ray transient was found to contain a significant fraction of the total energy of the ?-ray burst and, following the initial detection eight hours after the main burst, faded within a few days with a power-law decay function. The rapid locating of this ?-ray burst instigated a multi-wavelength observational campaign that culminated in the identification of a fading optical transient in a position consistent with the X-ray transient reported here.},

 back onto the hole at a rate that can initially exceed the
 Eddington limit by orders of magnitude. We argue that the
 angular momentum of this matter is too low to allow it to
 attain a disk-like configuration with accretion proceeding
 at a mildly super-Eddington rate, the excess energy being
 carried away by a combination of radiative losses and
 radially distributed winds. Instead, we propose that the
 infalling gas traps accretion energy until it inflates into
 a weakly bound, quasi-spherical structure with gas
 extending nearly to the poles. We study the structure and
 evolution of such "zero-Bernoulli accretion" flows as a
 model for the super-Eddington phase of TDEs. We argue that
 such flows cannot stop extremely super-Eddington accretion
 from occurring, and that once the envelope is maximally
 inflated, any excess accretion energy escapes through the
 poles in the form of powerful jets. We compare the
 predictions of our model to Swift J1644+57, the putative
 super-Eddington TDE, and show that it can qualitatively
 reproduce some of its observed features. Similar models,
 including self-gravity, could be applicable to gamma-ray
 bursts from collapsars and the growth of SMBH seeds inside
 quasi-stars.},

  Abstract                 = {Within the first 10 days after Swift discovered the jetted
 tidal disruption event (TDE) Sw J1644+57, simultaneous
 observations in the radio, near-infrared, optical, X-ray
 and gamma-ray bands were carried out. These multiwavelength
 data provide a unique opportunity to constrain the emission
 mechanism and make-up of a relativistic super-Eddington
 jet. We consider an exhaustive variety of radiation
 mechanisms for the generation of X-rays in this TDE, and
 rule out many processes such as SSC, photospheric and
 proton synchrotron. The infrared to gamma-ray data for Sw
 J1644+57 are consistent with synchrotron and
 external-inverse-Compton (EIC) processes provided that
 electrons in the jet are continuously accelerated on a time
 scale shorter than ~1% of the dynamical time to maintain a
 power-law distribution. The requirement of continuous
 electron acceleration points to magnetic reconnection in a
 Poynting flux dominated jet. The EIC process may require
 fine tuning to explain the observed temporal decay of the
 X-ray lightcurve, whereas the synchrotron process in a
 magnetic jet needs no fine tuning for this TDE.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the efficiency and dynamics of supermassive black
 hole binary mergers driven by angular momentum loss to
 small-scale gas discs. Such binaries form after major
 galaxy mergers, but their fate is unclear since hardening
 through stellar scattering becomes very inefficient at
 subparsec distances. Gas discs may dominate binary dynamics
 on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical
 simulations, we investigate the evolution of the semimajor
 axis and eccentricity of binaries embedded within
 geometrically thin gas discs. Our simulations directly
 resolve angular momentum transport within the disc, which
 at the radii of interest is likely dominated by disc
 self-gravity. We show that the binary decays at a rate
 which is in good agreement with analytical estimates, while
 the eccentricity grows. Saturation of eccentricity growth
 is not observed up to values e >\~{} 0.35. Accretion on to
 the black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by
 the binary orbital frequency. Scaling our results, we
 analytically estimate the maximum rate of binary decay that
 is possible without fragmentation occurring within the
 surrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate
 of the stellar dynamical hardening rate. For binary masses
 in the range 105 <\~{} M <\~{} 108Msolar we find that decay
 due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a \~{}
 0.01-0.1pc, in the regime where the disc is optically
 thick. The minimum merger time-scale is shorter than the
 Hubble time for M <\~{} 107Msolar. This implies that gas
 discs could commonly attend relatively low-mass black hole
 mergers, and that a significant population of binaries
 might exist at separations of a few hundredths of a parsec,
 where the combined decay rate is slowest. For more massive
 binaries, where this mechanism fails to act quickly enough,
 we suggest that scattering of stars formed within a
 fragmenting gas disc could act as a significant additional
 sink of binary angular momentum.},

 particular the accretion of gas on to Sgr A*, the

 use state-of-the-art observational data on orbits and wind
 properties of individual wind-producing stars. Since wind
 velocities were revised upwards and non-zero eccentricities
 were considered, our new simulations show fewer clumps of
 cold gas and no conspicuous disc-like structure. The
 accretion rate is dominated by a few close `slow-wind
 stars' (vw <= 750kms-1), and is consistent with the Bondi
 estimate, but variable on time-scales of tens to hundreds
 of years. This variability is due to the stochastic infall
 of cold clumps of gas, as in earlier simulations, and to
 the eccentric orbits of stars. The present models fail to
 explain the high luminosity of Sgr A* a few hundred years
 ago implied by Integral observations, but we argue that the
 accretion of a cold clump with a small impact parameter
 could have caused it. Finally, we show the possibility of
 constraining the total mass-loss rate of the `slow-wind
 stars' using near infrared observations of gas in the
 central few arcseconds.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a detailed discussion of our new 3D numerical
 models for the accretion of stellar winds on to Sgr A*. In
 our most sophisticated models, we put stellar wind sources
 on realistic orbits around Sgr A*, we include recently
 discovered `slow' winds (vw~ 300kms-1), and we account for
 optically thin radiative cooling. We test our approach by
 first modelling only one-phase `fast' stellar winds (vw~
 1000kms-1). For stellar wind sources fixed in space, the
 accretion rate is of the order of , fluctuates by <~10 per
 cent, and is in good agreement with previous models. In
 contrast, decreases by an order of magnitude for wind
 sources following circular orbits, and fluctuates by ~50
 per cent. Then we allow a fraction of stars to produce slow
 winds. Much of these winds cool radiatively after being
 shocked, forming cold clumps and filaments immersed into
 the X-ray-emitting gas. We investigate two orbital
 configurations for the stars in this scenario, an isotropic
 distribution and two rotating discs with perpendicular
 orientation. The morphology of cold gas is quite sensitive
 to the orbital distribution of the stars. In both cases,
 however, most of the accreted gas is hot, producing a
 quasi-steady `floor' in the accretion rate, of the order of
 ~3 Ã— 10-6Msolaryr-1, consistent with the values deduced
 from Chandra observations. The cold gas accretes in
 intermittent, short but powerful accretion episodes, which
 may give rise to large-amplitude variability in the
 luminosity of Sgr A* on time-scales of tens to hundreds of
 years. The circularization radii for the flows are about
 103 and 104 Schwarzschild radii, for the one- and two-phase
 wind simulations, respectively, never forming the
 quasi-spherical accretion flows suggested in some previous
 work. Our work suggests that, averaged over time-scales of
 hundreds to thousands of years, the radiative and
 mechanical luminosity of Sgr A* may be substantially higher
 than it is in its current state. Further improvements of
 the wind accretion modelling of Sgr A* will rely on
 improved observational constraints for the wind velocities,
 mass-loss rates and stellar orbits.},

  Abstract                 = {Sgr A* is currently being fed by winds from a cluster of
 gravitationally bound young mass-losing stars. Using
 observational constraints on the orbits, mass-loss rates
 and wind velocities of these stars, we numerically model
 the distribution of gas in the ~ 0.1-10 arcsec region
 around Sgr A*. We find that radiative cooling of recently
 discovered slow winds leads to the formation of many cool
 filaments and blobs, and to a thin and rather light
 accretion disc on a scale of about an arcsecond. The disc,
 however, does not extend all the way to our inner boundary.
 Instead, hot X-ray-emitting gas dominates the inner
 arcsecond. In our simulations, cool streams of gas
 frequently enter this region on low angular momentum
 orbits, and are then disrupted and heated up to the ambient
 hot gas temperature. The accreting gas around Sgr A* is
 thus two-phase, with a hot component, observable at X-ray
 wavelengths, and a cool component, which may be responsible
 for the majority of the time variability of Sgr A* emission
 on time-scales of 100-1000 yr. We obtain an accretion rate
 of a few Ã—10-6Msolaryr-1, consistent with Chandra
 estimates, but variable on time-scales even shorter than
 100 yr. These results strongly depend on the chosen stellar
 orbits and wind parameters. Further observational input is
 thus key to a better modelling of the Sgr A* wind
 accretion.},

  Abstract                 = {We show that collisions with stellar-mass black holes can
 partially explain the absence of bright giant stars in the
 Galactic Centre, first noted by Genzel et al. We show that
 the missing objects are low-mass giants and asymptotic
 giant branch stars in the range 1-3Msolar. Using detailed
 stellar evolution calculations, we find that to prevent
 these objects from evolving to become visible in the
 depleted K bands, we require that they suffer collisions on
 the red giant branch, and we calculate the fractional
 envelope mass losses required. Using a combination of
 smoothed particle hydrodynamic calculations, restricted
 three-body analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, we compute
 the expected collision rates between giants and black
 holes, and between giants and main-sequence stars in the
 Galactic Centre. We show that collisions can plausibly
 explain the missing giants in the 10.5 < K < 12 band.
 However, depleting the brighter (K < 10.5) objects out to
 the required radius would require a large population of
 black hole impactors which would in turn deplete the 10.5 <
 K < 12 giants in a region much larger than is observed. We
 conclude that collisions with stellar-mass black holes
 cannot account for the depletion of the very brightest
 giants, and we use our results to place limits on the
 population of stellar-mass black holes in the Galactic
 Centre.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work, we present and analyze a new analytic
 solution for the saturated (flux-limited) thermal
 evaporation of a spherical cloud. This work is
 distinguished from earlier analytic studies by allowing the
 thermal conductivity to change continuously from a
 diffusive to a saturated form, in a manner usually employed
 only in numerical calculations. This closed form solution
 will be of interest as a computational benchmark. Using our
 calculated temperature profiles and mass-loss rates, we
 model the thermal evaporation of such a cloud under typical
 interstellar medium (ISM) conditions, with some
 restrictions. We examine the ionization structure of the
 cloud-ISM interface and evaluate column densities of
 carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, and silicon ions toward the
 cloud. In accord with other investigations, we find that
 ionization equilibrium is far from satisfied under the
 assumed conditions. Since the inclusion of saturation
 effects in the heat flux narrows the thermal interface
 relative to its classical structure, we also find that
 saturation effects tend to lower predicted column
 densities.},

 There is evidence that the dynamical properties of

 connection with the present investigation, major axis
 spectra have been obtained. Rotation and velocity
 dispersion profiles have been derived for four elliptical
 galaxies NGC 3379, NGC 4839, NGC 4889 and NGC 6909, and for
 the probable S0 galaxy NGC 584. NGC 3379 is consistent with
 being a rotationally-flattened isotropic-dispersion
 constant M/L oblate spheroid. While NGC 584 is classified
 E/S0, it is most likely an S0. If so, it, along with NGC
 128 and NGC 4595, has the most luminous bulges for which
 kinematical data are available. For NGC 4839 and NGC 4889,
 two of the three brightest galaxies in Coma, virtually no

  Abstract                 = {As part of the mm-Wave Interferometric Survey of Dark
 Object Masses (WISDOM) project, we present an estimate of
 the mass of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the
 nearby fast-rotating early-type galaxy NGC 4697. This
 estimate is based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
 Array (ALMA) cycle-3 observations of the 12CO(2-1) emission
 line with a linear resolution of 29 pc (0.53 arcsec). We
 find that NGC 4697 hosts a small relaxed central molecular
 gas disc with a mass of 1.6 ?107 M?, co-spatial with the
 obscuring dust disc visible in optical Hubble Space
 Telescope imaging. We also resolve thermal 1 mm continuum
 emission from the dust in this disc. NGC 4697 is found to
 have a very low molecular gas velocity dispersion, ?gas =
 1.65^{+0.68}_{-0.65} km s-1. This seems to be partially
 because the giant molecular cloud mass function is not
 fully sampled, but other mechanisms such as chemical
 differentiation in a hard radiation field or morphological
 quenching also seem to be required. We detect a Keplerian
 increase of the rotation of the molecular gas in the very
 centre of NGC 4697, and use forward modelling of the ALMA
 data cube in a Bayesian framework with the KINematic
 Molecular Simulation (kinms) code to estimate an SMBH mass
 of (1.3_{-0.17}^{+0.18}) ?108 M? and an I-band
 mass-to-light ratio of 2.14_{-0.05}^{+0.04} M?/L? (at the
 99 per cent confidence level). Our estimate of the SMBH
 mass is entirely consistent with previous measurements from
 stellar kinematics. This increases confidence in the
 growing number of SMBH mass estimates being obtained in the
 ALMA era.},

 Relativistic Jets Triggered by Tidal Disruption of Stars in
 Quiescent Supermassive Black Holes}},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the consequences of a model in which
 relativistic jets can be triggered in quiescent massive
 black holes when a geometrically thick and hot accretion
 disk forms as a result of the tidal disruption of a star.
 To estimate the power, thrust, and lifetime of the jet, we
 use the mass accretion history onto the black hole as
 calculated by detailed hydrodynamic simulations of the
 tidal disruption of stars. We go on to determine the states
 of the interstellar medium in various types of quiescent
 galactic nuclei, and describe how this external matter can
 affect jets propagating through it. We use this
 information, together with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic
 model of the structure of the relativistic flow, to study
 the dynamics of the jet, the propagation of which is
 regulated by the density stratification of the environment
 and by its injection history. The breaking of symmetry
 involved in transitioning from one to two dimensions is
 crucial and leads to qualitatively new phenomena. At early
 times, as the jet power increases, the high pressure of the
 cocoon collimates the jet, increasing its shock velocity as
 compared to that of spherical models. We show that small
 velocity gradients, induced near or at the source, steepen
 into internal shocks and provide a source of free energy
 for particle acceleration and radiation along the jet's
 channel. The jets terminate at a working surface where they
 interact strongly with the surrounding medium through a
 combination of shock waves and instabilities; a continuous
 flow of relativistic fluid emanating from the nucleus
 supplies this region with mass, momentum, and energy.
 Information about the t -5/3 decrease in power supply
 propagates within the jet at the internal sound speed. As a
 result, the internal energy at the jet head continues to
 accumulate until long after the peak feeding rate is
 reached. An appreciable time delay is thus expected between
 peaks in the short-wavelength radiation emanating near the
 jet's origin and the long-wavelength emission produced at
 the head of the jet. Many of the observed properties of the
 Swift 1644+57/GRB 110328A event can be understood as
 resulting from accretion onto and jets driven by a 106 M
 &sun; central mass black hole following the disruption of a
 sun-like star. With the inclusion of a stochastic
 contribution to the luminosity due to variations in the
 feeding rate driven by instabilities near the tidal radius,
 we find that our model can explain the X-ray light curve
 without invoking a rarely occurring deep encounter. In
 conjunction with the number density of black holes in the
 local universe, we hypothesize that the conditions required
 to produce the Swift event are not anomalous, but are in
 fact representative of the jet-driven flare population
 arising from tidal disruptions.},

  Abstract                 = {We report on the results of a four-year long X-ray
 monitoring campaign of the central 1.2 square degrees of
 our Galaxy, performed with Chandra and XMM-Newton between
 2005 and 2008. Our study focuses on the properties of
 transient X-ray sources that reach 2-10 keV luminosities of
 LX â‰³ 1034 erg s-1 for an assumed distance of 8 kpc. There
 are 17 known X-ray transients within the field of view of
 our campaign, eight of which were detected in outburst
 during our observations: the transient neutron star
 low-mass X-ray binaries GRS 1741-2853, AX J1745.6-2901, SAX
 J1747.0-2853, KS 1741-293 (all four are also known X-ray
 bursters), and GRO J1744-28 (a 2.1 Hz X-ray pulsar), and
 the unclassified X-ray transients XMM J174457-2850.3, CXOGC
 J174535.5-290124 and CXOGC J174541.0-290014. We present
 their X-ray spectra and flux evolution during our campaign,
 and discuss our results in light of their historic
 activity. Our main results include the detection of two
 thermonuclear X-ray bursts from SAX J1747.0-2853 that were
 separated by an unusually short time interval of 3.8 min.
 Investigation of the lightcurves of AX J1745.6-2901
 revealed one thermonuclear X-ray burst and a ~1600-s long
 X-ray eclipse. We found that both XMM J174457-2850.3 and
 GRO J1744-28 displayed weak X-ray activity above their
 quiescent levels at LX ~ 1033-34 erg s-1, which is
 indicative of low-level accretion. We compare this kind of
 activity with the behaviour of low-luminosity X-ray
 transients that display 2-10 keV peak luminosities of LX ~
 1034 erg s-1 and have never been seen to become brighter.
 In addition to the eight known X-ray transients, we
 discovered a previously unknown X-ray source that we
 designate XMMU J174654.1-291542. This object emits most of
 its photons above 2 keV and appears to be persistent at a
 luminosity of LX ~ 1034 erg s-1, although it exhibits
 strong spectral variability on a time scale of months.
 Based on its X-ray properties and the possible association
 with an infrared source, we tentatively classify this
 object as a cataclysmic variable. No new transients were
 found during our campaign, reinforcing the conclusion of
 previous authors that most X-ray transients recurring on a
 time scale of less than a decade have now been identified
 near the Galactic centre. Tables 1-3 and Appendix A are

  Abstract                 = {In 2006 February, shortly after its launch, Swift began
 monitoring the center of the Milky Way with the on board
 X-Ray Telescope using short 1-ks exposures performed every
 1-4 days. Between 2006 and 2014 over 1200 observations have
 been obtained, accumulating to ~= 1.3 Ms of exposure time.
 This has yielded a wealth of information about the
 long-term X-ray behavior of the supermassive black hole Sgr
 A*, and numerous transient X-ray binaries that are located
 within the 25' Ã—25' region covered by the campaign. In
 this review we highlight the discoveries made during these
 first nine years, which include 1) the detection of seven
 bright X-ray flares from Sgr A*, 2) the discovery of the
 magnetar SGR J1745-29, 3) the first systematic analysis of
 the outburst light curves and energetics of the peculiar
 class of very-faint X-ray binaries, 4) the discovery of
 three new transient X-ray sources, 5) the exposure of
 low-level accretion in otherwise bright X-ray binaries, and
 6) the identification of a candidate X-ray
 binary/millisecond radio pulsar transitional object. We
 also reflect on future science to be done by continuing
 this Swift's legacy campaign, such as high-cadence
 monitoring to study how the interaction between the gaseous
 object 'G2' and Sgr A* plays out in the future.},

 ratios [alpha/Fe] for a sample of 83 early-type galaxies

 stellar-population properties derived for each galaxy
 correspond to the nuclear re/8 aperture extraction. The
 median age found for Es is 5.8+/-0.6 Gyr and the average
 metallicity is +0.37+/-0.03 dex. For S0s, the median age is
 3.0+/-0.6 Gyr and [Z/H]= 0.53+/-0.04 dex. We compare the
 distribution of our galaxies in the Hbeta-[MgFe] diagram
 with Fornax galaxies. Our elliptical galaxies are 3-4 Gyr
 younger than Es in the Fornax cluster. We find that the
 galaxies lie in a plane defined by [Z/H]= 0.99 logsigma0-
 0.46 log(age) - 1.60, or in linear terms Z ~sigma0Ã— (age)
 -0.5. More massive (larger sigma0) and older galaxies
 present, on average, large [alpha/Fe] values, and therefore
 must have undergone shorter star-formation time-scales.
 Comparing group against field/isolated galaxies, it is not
 clear that environment plays an important role in
 determining their stellar-population history. In
 particular, our isolated galaxies show ages differing by
 more than 8 Gyr. Finally we explore our large spectral
 coverage to derive log(O/H) metallicity from the Halpha and
 NIIlambda6584 and compare it with model-dependent [Z/H]. We
 find that the O/H abundances are similar for all galaxies,
 and we can interpret it as if most chemical evolution has
 already finished in these galaxies.},

  Abstract                 = {The discovery of hard X-ray emission from a sample of six
 nearby elliptical galaxies, including the dominant galaxies
 of the Virgo, Fornax and Centaurus clusters (M87, NGC 1399
 and NGC 4696, respectively), and NGC 4472, 4636 and 4649 in
 the Virgo cluster, has important implications for the study
 of quiescent supermassive black holes. We describe how the
 broad-band spectral energy distributions for these
 galaxies, which accrete from their hot gaseous haloes at
 rates comparable to their Bondi rates, can be explained by
 low-radiative-efficiency accretion flows in which a
 significant fraction of the mass, angular momentum and
 energy is removed from the flows by winds. The observed
 suppression of the synchrotron components in the radio band
 (excluding the case of M87) and the systematically hard
 X-ray spectra, which are interpreted as thermal
 bremsstrahlung emission, support the conjecture that
 significant mass outflow is a natural consequence of
 systems accreting at low radiative efficiencies. We briefly
 discuss an alternative model for the observed X-ray
 emission, in which it is due to non-thermal
 synchrotron-self-Compton processes in the accretion flows,
 or outflows. This appears to require implausibly weak
 magnetic fields. Emission from a collimated jet viewed
 off-axis should be distinguishable from the bremsstrahlung
 model by variability and thermal line emission studies. We
 argue that the difference in radiative efficiency between
 the nuclei of spiral and elliptical galaxies may arise from
 the different manner in which interstellar gas is fed into
 the nuclei. In ellipticals, matter fed from the hot (slowly
 cooling) interstellar medium (ISM) is likely to be highly
 magnetized and have low specific angular momentum, which
 favours low-radiative-efficiency accretion solutions and,
 possibly, the formation of the observed jets.},

  Abstract                 = {We report on the structure of the nuclear star cluster in
 the innermost 0.16 pc of the Galaxy as measured by the
 number density profile of late-type giants. Using laser
 guide star adaptive optics in conjunction with the integral
 field spectrograph, OSIRIS, at the Keck II telescope, we
 are able to differentiate between the older, late-type (~ 1
 Gyr) stars, which are presumed to be dynamically relaxed,
 and the unrelaxed young (~ 6 Myr) population. This
 distinction is crucial for testing models of stellar cusp
 formation in the vicinity of a black hole, as the models
 assume that the cusp stars are in dynamical equilibrium in
 the black hole potential. In the survey region, we
 classified 60 stars as early-type (22 newly identified) and
 74 stars as late-type (61 newly identified). We find that
 contamination from young stars is significant, with more
 than twice as many young stars as old stars in our
 sensitivity range (K' < 15.5) within the central arcsecond.
 Based on the late-type stars alone, the surface stellar
 number density profile, Sigma(R) vprop R -Gamma, is flat,
 with Gamma = -0.27 $\pm$ 0.19. Monte Carlo simulations of
 the possible de-projected volume density profile, n(r)
 vpropr -gamma, show that gamma is less than 1.0 at the
 99.7% confidence level. These results are consistent with
 the nuclear star cluster having no cusp, with a core
 profile that is significantly flatter than that predicted
 by most cusp formation theories, and even allows for the
 presence of a central hole in the stellar distribution. Of
 the possible dynamical interactions that can lead to the
 depletion of the red giants observable in this
 survey---stellar collisions, mass segregation from stellar
 remnants, or a recent merger event---mass segregation is
 the only one that can be ruled out as the dominant
 depletion mechanism. The lack of a stellar cusp around a
 supermassive black hole would have important implications
 for black hole growth models and inferences on the presence
 of a black hole based upon stellar distributions.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, luminous X-ray outbursts with variability
 amplitudes as high as ~400 have been serendipitously
 detected from a small number of active and inactive
 galaxies. These outbursts may result from the tidal
 disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes, as well
 as accretion disk instabilities. In order to place the
 first reliable constraints on the rate of such outbursts in
 the universe and to test the stellar tidal disruption
 hypothesis, we have performed a systematic and complete
 survey for them by cross-correlating ROSAT All-Sky Survey
 (RASS) and pointed Position Sensitive Proportional Counter
 data. We have detected five galaxies that were in outburst
 during the RASS, three of which show no signs of nuclear
 activity; these objects had been reported on individually
 in previous studies. After making reasonable corrections
 for the complicated selection effects, we conclude that the
 rate of large-amplitude X-ray outbursts from inactive
 galaxies in the local universe is ~9.1Ã—10-6 galaxy-1 yr-1.
 This rate is consistent with the predicted rate of stellar
 tidal disruption events in such galaxies. When only the two
 active galaxies are considered, we find a rate for active
 galaxies of ~8.5Ã—10-4 galaxy-1 yr-1. In order to place
 tighter constraints on these rates, additional outbursts
 must be detected.},

  Abstract                 = {The dynamics of two massive black holes in a rotationally
 supported nuclear disc of mass Mdisc = 108Msolar is
 explored using N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics
 simulations. Gas and star particles are copresent in the
 disc. Described by a Mestel profile, the disc has a
 vertical support provided by turbulence of the gas, and by
 stellar velocity dispersion. A primary black hole of mass 4
 Ã— 106Msolar is placed at the centre of the disc, while a
 secondary black hole is set initially on an eccentric
 corotating orbit in the disc plane. Its mass is in a 1:1,
 1:4, and 1:10 ratio, relative to the primary. With this
 choice, we mimic the dynamics of black hole pairs released
 in the nuclear region at the end of a gas-rich galaxy
 merger. It is found that, under the action of dynamical
 friction, the two black holes form a close binary in \~{}10
 Myr. The inspiral process is insensitive to the mass
 fraction in stars and gas present in the disc and is
 accompanied by the circularization of the orbit. We detail
 the gaseous mass profile bound to each black hole that can
 lead to the formation of two small Keplerian discs,
 weighing \~{}2per cent of the black hole mass, and of size
 \~{}0.01 pc. The mass of the tightly (loosely) bound
 particles increases (decreases) with time as the black
 holes spiral into closer and closer orbits. Double active
 galactic nucleus activity is expected to occur on an
 estimated time-scale of <\~{}10 Myr, comparable to the
 inspiral time-scale. The double nuclear point-like sources
 that may appear during dynamical evolution will have
 typical separations of <\~{}10 pc.},

  Abstract                 = {We report on the discovery and observations of the
 extremely luminous optical transient
 CSS100217:102913+404220 (CSS100217 hereafter).
 Spectroscopic observations showed that this transient was
 coincident with a galaxy at redshift z = 0.147 and reached
 an apparent magnitude of V ~ 16.3. After correcting for
 foreground Galactic extinction we determine the absolute
 magnitude to be MV = -22.7 approximately 45 days after
 maximum light. Over a period of 287 rest-frame days, this
 event had an integrated bolometric luminosity of 1.3 Ã—
 1052 erg based on time-averaged bolometric corrections of
 ~15 from V- and R-band observations. Analysis of the
 pre-outburst Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectrum of
 the source shows features consistent with a narrow-line
 Seyfert 1 galaxy. High-resolution Hubble Space Telescope
 and Keck follow-up observations show that the event
 occurred within 150 pc of the nucleus of the galaxy,
 suggesting a possible link to the active nuclear region.
 However, the rapid outburst along with photometric and
 spectroscopic evolution are much more consistent with a
 luminous supernova. Line diagnostics suggest that the host
 galaxy is undergoing significant star formation. We use
 extensive follow-up of the event along with archival
 Catalina Sky Survey NEO search and SDSS data to investigate
 the three most likely sources of such an event: (1) an
 extremely luminous supernova, (2) the tidal disruption of a
 star by the massive nuclear black hole, and (3) variability
 of the central active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find that
 CSS100217 was likely an extremely luminous Type IIn
 supernova and occurred within the range of the narrow-line
 region of an AGN. We discuss how similar events may have
 been missed in past supernova surveys because of confusion
 with AGN activity.},

  Abstract                 = {The SHARP/NTT stellar proper motion data now cover an interval from 1992 to 2000 and allow us to determine orbital accelerations for some of the most central stars of the Galaxy. We confirm the stellar acceleration measurements obtained by Ghez et al. with NIRC at the Keck telescope. Our analysis differs in three main points from that of Ghez et al.: (1) we combine the high-precision but shorter time-scale NIRC/Keck data with the lower precision but longer time-scale SHARP/NTT data set; (2) we statistically correct the observed accelerations for geometrical projection effects; (3) we exclude star S8 from the analysis of the amount and position of the central mass. From the combined SHARP/NTT and NIRC/Keck data sets we show that the stars S2, and most likely S1 and S8 as well, are on bound, fairly inclined (60°<i <80°), and eccentric (0.4<e <0.95) orbits around a central dark mass. The combination of both data sets results in a position of this central mass of and of the nominal radio position of Sgr A*. The mean statistically corrected enclosed mass derived from accelerations is M acc =(5+/-3)×106 Msolar with current radial separations of S1 and S2 from Sgr A* of about 8-10mpc. This enclosed mass estimate is derived from individual stellar orbits as close to the massive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way as currently possible. Although the uncertainties are large, this estimate is fully consistent with the enclosed mass range of (2.6-3.3)×106 Msolar derived by Genzel et al. from radial and/or proper motion velocities of a homogenized sample of sources. Star S8 was excluded from the analysis, since for the current proper motion velocity and radial separation from the centre we find that the measured acceleration requires orbital motion around a compact object with a mass in excess of 3×106 Msolar . The data suggest either that this star was or is subject to a close interaction with a different object or that its position measurements are influenced by the emission of a different cluster star. Therefore we base the analysis of the enclosed mass solely on the available data for stars S1 and S2. We also discuss two late-type stars with projected separations from Sgr A* of about 0.5 and 1arcsec. In addition to proper motions, these stars have known radial velocities. Orbit calculations indicate that such stars are very likely at larger physical distances from the centre and part of the larger scale central stellar cluster with a core radius of approximately 0.3pc.},

  Abstract                 = {Two-dimensional stellar kinematics of 48 representative
 elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies obtained with
 the SAURON integral-field spectrograph reveal that
 early-type galaxies appear in two broad flavours, depending
 on whether they exhibit clear large-scale rotation or not.
 We define a new parameter , which involves
 luminosity-weighted averages over the full two-dimensional
 kinematic field as a proxy to quantify the observed
 projected stellar angular momentum per unit mass. We use it
 as a basis for a new kinematic classification: early-type
 galaxies are separated into slow and fast rotators,
 depending on whether they have lambdaR values within their
 effective radius Re below or above 0.1, respectively. Slow
 and fast rotators are shown to be physically distinct
 classes of galaxies, a result which cannot simply be the
 consequence of a biased viewing angle. Fast rotators tend
 to be relatively low-luminosity galaxies with MB >~ -20.5.
 Slow rotators tend to be brighter and more massive
 galaxies, but are still spread over a wide range of
 absolute magnitude. Three slow rotators of our sample,
 among the most massive ones, are consistent with zero
 rotation. Remarkably, all other slow rotators (besides the
 atypical case of NGC 4550) contain a large kpc-scale
 kinematically decoupled core (KDC). All fast rotators
 (except one galaxy with well-known irregular shells) show
 well-aligned photometric and kinemetric axes, and small
 velocity twists, in contrast with most slow rotators which
 exhibit significant misalignments and velocity twists.
 These results are supported by a supplement of 18
 additional early-type galaxies observed with SAURON. In a
 companion paper (Paper X), we also show that fast and slow
 rotators are distinct classes in terms of their orbital
 distribution. We suggest that gas is a key ingredient in
 the formation and evolution of fast rotators, and that the
 slowest rotators are the extreme evolutionary end point
 reached deep in gravitational potential wells where
 dissipationless mergers had a major role in the evolution,
 and for which most of the baryonic angular momentum was
 expelled outwards. Detailed numerical simulations in a
 cosmological context are required to understand how to form
 large-scale KDCs within slow rotators, and more generally
 to explain the distribution of lambdaR values within
 early-type galaxies and the distinction between fast and
 slow rotators.},

  Abstract                 = {Context: In recent years, giant amplitude X-ray flares
 have been observed from a handful of non-active galaxies.
 The most plausible scenario of these unusual phenomena is
 tidal disruption of a star by a quiescent supermassive
 black hole at the centre of the galaxy. Aims: Only a small
 number of these type of events have been observed and
 confirmed to date. The discovery of more cases would allow
 a number of fundamental conclusions to be drawn about
 properties such as the frequency of tidal disruption
 events, the distribution of quiescent black hole masses and
 their influence in the context of galaxy/AGN formation and
 evolution among others. Methods: Comparing the XMM-Newton
 Slew Survey Source Catalogue with the ROSAT PSPC All-Sky
 Survey five galaxies have been detected a factor of up to
 88 brighter in XMM-Newton with respect to ROSAT PSPC upper
 limits and presenting a soft X-ray colour. X-ray
 luminosities of these sources derived from slew
 observations have been found in the range 1041{-}1044 erg
 s-1, fully consistent with the tidal disruption model. This
 model predicts that during the peak of the outburst, flares
 reach X-ray luminosities up to 1045 erg s-1, which is close
 to the Eddington luminosity of the black hole, and
 afterwards a decay of the flux on a time scale of months to
 years is expected. Multi-wavelength follow-up observations
 have been performed on these highly variable objects in
 order to disentangle their nature and to investigate their
 dynamical evolution. Results: Here we present sources
 coming from the XMM-Newton Slew Survey that could fit in
 the paradigm of tidal disruption events. X-ray and optical
 observations revealed that two of these objects are in full
 agreement with that scenario and three other sources that,
 showing signs of optical activity, need further
 investigation within the transient galactic nuclei

  Abstract                 = {We analyze Hubble Space Telescope surface-brightness
 profiles of 61 elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges
 (hereafter "hot" galaxies). The profiles are parameterized
 by break radius rbetaand break surface brightness 1beta
 These are combined with central velocity dispersions, total
 luminosities, rotation velocities, and isophote shapes to
 explore correlations among central and global properties.
 Luminous hot galaxies (Mv<-22) have cuspy cores with steep
 outer power-law profiles that break at râ‰ˆrbeta to shallow
 inner profiles Iâˆr-gamma with gamma<=0.3. Break radii and
 core luminosities for these objects are approximately
 proportional to effective radii and total luminosities.
 Scaling relations are presented for several core parameters
 as a function of total luminosity. Cores follow a
 fundamental plane that parallels the global fundamental
 plane for hot galaxies but is 30% thicker. Some of this
 extra thickness may be due to the effect of massive black
 holes (BHs) on central velocity dispersions. Faint hot
 galaxies (Mv>-20.5) show steep, largely featureless
 power-law profiles that lack cores. Measured values of rb
 and b for these galaxies are limits only. At a limiting
 radius of 10 pc, the centers of power-law galaxies are up
 to 1000 times denser in mass and luminosity than the cores
 of large galaxies. At intermediate magnitudes
 (-22<Mv<-20.5), core and power-law galaxies coexist, and
 there is a range in rbeta at a given luminosity of at least
 two orders of magnitude. Here, central properties correlate
 strongly with global rotation and shape: core galaxies tend
 to be boxy and slowly rotating, whereas power-law galaxies
 tend to be disky and rapidly rotating. A search for inner
 disks was conducted to test a claim in the literature,
 based on a smaller sample, that power laws originate from
 edge-on stellar disks. We find only limited evidence for
 such disks and believe that the difference between core and
 power-law profiles reflects a real difference in the
 spatial distribution of the luminous spheroidal component
 of the galaxy. The dense power-law centers of disky,
 rotating galaxies are consistent with their formation in
 gas-rich mergers. The parallel proposition, that cores are
 the by-products of gas-free stellar mergers, is less
 compelling for at least two reasons: (1) dissipationless
 hierarchical clustering does not appear to produce core
 profiles like those seen; (2) core galaxies accrete small,
 dense, gas-free galaxies at a rate sufficient to fill in
 their low-density cores if the satellites survived and sank
 to the center (whether the satellites survive is still an
 open question). An alternative model for core formation
 involves the orbital decay of massive BHs that are accreted
 in mergers: the decaying BHs may heat and eject stars from
 the center, eroding a power law if any exists and scouring
 out a core. An average BH mass per spheroid of 0.002 times
 the stellar mass yields cores in fair agreement with
 observed cores and is consistent with the energetics of
 AGNs and the kinematic detection of BHs in nearby galaxies.
 An unresolved issue is why power-law galaxies also do not
 have cores if this process operates in all hot galaxies.},

 indirect estimates of the rate of jetted-TDEs, and of the
 energy they inject, are compatible with the observed flux
 of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and the abundance

  Abstract                 = {We construct triaxial dynamical models for the Milky Way nuclear star cluster using Schwarzschild's orbit superposition technique. We fit the stellar kinematic maps presented in Feldmeier et al. The models are used to constrain the supermassive black hole mass M?, dynamical mass-to-light ratio ? and the intrinsic shape of the cluster. Our best-fitting model has M? = (3.0^{+1.1}_{-1.3}) × 106 M?, ? = (0.90^{+0.76}_{-0.08}) M?/L?, 4.5?m and a compression of the cluster along the line of sight. Our results are in agreement with the direct measurement of the supermassive black hole mass using the motion of stars on Keplerian orbits. The mass-to-light ratio is consistent with stellar population studies of other galaxies in the mid-infrared. It is possible that we underestimate M? and overestimate the cluster's triaxiality due to observational effects. The spatially semiresolved kinematic data and extinction within the nuclear star cluster bias the observations to the near side of the cluster, and may appear as a compression of the nuclear star cluster along the line of sight. We derive a total dynamical mass for the Milky Way nuclear star cluster of MMWNSC = (2.1 ± 0.7) × 107 M? within a sphere with radius r = 2 × reff = 8.4 pc. The best-fitting model is tangentially anisotropic in the central r = 0.5-2 pc of the nuclear star cluster, but close to isotropic at larger radii. Our triaxial models are able to recover complex kinematic substructures in the velocity map.},

 perfectly with the velocity dispersions of their host
 bulges, Mbh~??, where ?=4.8+/-0.5. The relation is much
 tighter than the relation between Mbh and bulge luminosity,
 with a scatter no larger than expected on the basis of
 measurement error alone. Black hole masses recently
 estimated by Magorrian et al. lie systematically above the
 Mbh-? relation defined by more accurate mass estimates,
 some by as much as 2 orders of magnitude. The tightness of
 the Mbh-? relation implies a strong link between black hole
 formation and the properties of the stellar bulge.},

 three-dimensional picture of the interstellar gas out to
 about 10 pc of the dynamical center of our Galaxy, which is
 supposed to be at Sgr A*. Methods: We review the existing
 observational studies on the different gaseous components
 that have been identified near Sgr A*, and retain all the
 information relating to their spatial configuration and/or
 physical state. Based on the collected information, we
 propose a three-dimensional representation of the
 interstellar gas, which describes each component in terms
 of both its precise location and morphology and its
 thermodynamic properties. Results: The interstellar gas
 near Sgr A* can be represented by five basic components,
 which are, by order of increasing size: (1) a central
 cavity with roughly equal amounts of warm ionized and
 atomic gases; (2) a ring of mainly molecular gas; (3) a
 supernova remnant filled with hot ionized gas; (4) a radio
 halo of warm ionized gas and relativistic particles; and
 (5) a belt of massive molecular clouds. While the halo gas
 fills â‰ˆ80% of the studied volume, the molecular
 components enclose â‰ˆ 98% of the interstellar mass.},

  Abstract                 = {The relaxed distribution of stars around a massive black hole is known to follow a cusp profile, ? (r)\propto {r}-? , with a characteristic slope ? =7/4. This follows from energy conservation and a scattering rate given by two-body encounters. However, we show that the injection of stars close to the black hole, i.e., a source term in the standard cusp picture, modifies this profile. In the steady-state configuration, the cusp develops a central region with a typical slope ? =9/4 in which stars diffuse outward. Binary disruption by the intense tidal field of the massive black hole is among the phenomena that take place in the Galactic Center (GC). In such a disruption, one of the binary members remains bound to the black hole, thus providing a source term of stars close to the black hole. Assuming a binary fraction of 0.1 and an orbital circularization efficiency of 0.35, we show that this source is strong enough to modify the cusp profile within ? 0.07 pc of the GC. If the binary fraction at the influence radius is of order unity and the orbits of all captured stars are efficiently circularized, the steeper cusp extends almost as far as the radius of influence of the black hole.},

  Abstract                 = {We report on the results of an extensive monitoring campaign of the radio afterglow of GRB 970508, lasting 450 days after the burst. The spectral and temporal radio behavior indicate that the fireball has undergone a transition to subrelativistic expansion at t~100 days. This allows us to perform ``calorimetry'' of the explosion. The derived total energy, E0~5×1050 ergs, is well below the ~5×1051 ergs inferred under the assumption of spherical symmetry from gamma-ray and early afterglow observations. A natural consequence of this result, which can also account for deviations at t<100 days from the spherical relativistic fireball model predictions, is that the fireball was initially a wide-angle jet of opening angle ~30°. Our analysis also allows determination of the energy fractions carried by the electrons and magnetic field and the density of the ambient medium surrounding the fireball. We find that during the subrelativistic expansion, the electrons and magnetic field are close to equipartition and the density of the ambient medium is ~1 cm -3. The inferred density rules out the possibility that the fireball expands into a strongly nonuniform medium, as would be expected, e.g., in the case of a massive star progenitor.},

  Abstract                 = {Physical collisions between stars occur frequently in
 dense star clusters, either via close encounters between
 two single stars, or during strong dynamical interactions
 involving binary stars. Here we study stellar collisions
 that occur during binary-single and binary-binary
 interactions, by performing numerical scattering
 experiments. Our results include cross-sections, branching
 ratios and sample distributions of parameters for various
 outcomes. For interactions of hard binaries containing
 main-sequence stars, we find that the normalized
 cross-section for at least one collision to occur (between
 any two of the four stars involved) is essentially unity,
 and that the probability of collisions involving more than
 two stars is significant. Hydrodynamic calculations have
 shown that the effective radius of a collision product can
 be 2-30 times larger than the normal main-sequence radius
 for a star of the same total mass. We study the effect of
 this expansion, and find that it increases the probability
 of further collisions considerably. We discuss these
 results in the context of recent observations of blue
 stragglers in globular clusters with masses exceeding twice
 the main-sequence turn-off mass. We also present FEWBODY, a
 new, freely available numerical toolkit for simulating
 small-N gravitational dynamics that is particularly suited
 to performing scattering experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {The study of how stars distribute themselves around a
 massive black hole (MBH) in the center of a galaxy is an
 important prerequisite for the understanding of many
 galactic-center processes. These include the observed
 overabundance of point X-ray sources at the Galactic center
 and the prediction of rates and characteristics of tidal
 disruptions of extended stars by the MBH and of inspirals
 of compact stars into the MBH, the latter being events of
 high importance for the future space-borne gravitational
 wave interferometer LISA. In relatively small galactic
 nuclei hosting MBHs with masses in the range 105-107
 Msolar, the single most important dynamical process is
 two-body relaxation. It induces the formation of a steep
 density cusp around the MBH and strong mass segregation, as
 more massive stars lose energy to lighter ones and drift to
 the central regions. Using a spherical stellar dynamical
 Monte Carlo code, we simulate the long-term relaxational
 evolution of galactic nucleus models with a spectrum of
 stellar masses. Our focus is the concentration of stellar
 black holes to the immediate vicinity of the MBH. We
 quantify this mass segregation for a variety of galactic
 nucleus models and discuss its astrophysical implications.
 Special attention is given to models developed to match the
 conditions in the Milky Way nucleus; we examine the
 presence of compact objects in connection to recent
 high-resolution X-ray observations.},

  Abstract                 = {We have recently written a new code to simulate the long
 term evolution of spherical clusters of stars. It is based
 on the pioneering Monte Carlo scheme proposed by H{\'e}non
 in the 70's. Unlike other implementations of this numerical
 method which were successfully used to investigate the
 dynamics of globular clusters, our code has been devised in
 the specific goal to treat dense galactic nuclei. In a
 previous paper, we described the basic version of our code
 which includes 2-body relaxation as the only physical
 process. In the present work, we go on and include further
 physical ingredients that are mostly relevant to galactic
 nuclei, namely the presence of a central (growing) black
 hole (BH) and collisions between (main sequence) stars.
 Stars that venture too close to the BH are destroyed by the
 tidal field. We took particular care of this process
 because of its importance, both as a channel to feed the BH
 and a way to produce accretion flares from otherwise
 quiescent galactic nuclei. Collisions between stars have
 often been proposed as another mechanism to drive stellar
 matter into the central BH. Furthermore, non disruptive
 collisions may create peculiar stellar populations which
 are of great observational interest in the case of the
 central cluster of our Galaxy. To get the best handle on
 the role of this process in galactic nuclei, we include it
 with unpreceded realism through the use of a set of more
 than 10 000 collision simulations carried out with a SPH
 (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) code. Stellar evolution
 has also been introduced in a simple way, similar to what
 has been done in previous dynamical simulations of galactic
 nuclei. To ensure that this physics is correctly simulated,
 we realized a variety of tests whose results are reported
 here. This unique code, featuring most important physical
 processes, allows million particle simulations, spanning a
 Hubble time, in a few CPU days on standard personal
 computers and provides a wealth of data only rivalized by
 N-body simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {We constrain the recent star formation histories of the host galaxies of eight optical/UV-detected tidal disruption events (TDEs). Six hosts had quick starbursts of <200 Myr duration that ended 10-1000 Myr ago, indicating that TDEs arise at different times in their hosts? post-starburst evolution. If the disrupted star formed in the burst or before, the post-burst age constrains its mass, generally excluding O, most B, and highly massive A stars. If the starburst arose from a galaxy merger, the time since the starburst began limits the coalescence timescale and thus the merger mass ratio to more equal than 12:1 in most hosts. This uncommon ratio, if also that of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary, disfavors the scenario in which the TDE rate is boosted by the binary but is insensitive to its mass ratio. The stellar mass fraction created in the burst is 0.5%-10% for most hosts, not enough to explain the observed 30-200× boost in TDE rates, suggesting that the host?s core stellar concentration is more important. TDE hosts have stellar masses 109.4-1010.3 M?, consistent with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey volume-corrected, quiescent Balmer-strong comparison sample and implying SMBH masses of 105.5-107.5 M?.

  Abstract                 = {Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) are transient events observed when a star passes close enough to a supermassive black hole to be tidally destroyed. Many TDE candidates have been discovered in host galaxies whose spectra have weak or no line emission yet strong Balmer line absorption, indicating a period of intense star formation that has recently ended. As such, TDE host galaxies fall into the rare class of quiescent Balmer-strong galaxies. Here, we quantify the fraction of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with spectral properties like those of TDE hosts, determining the extent to which TDEs are over-represented in such galaxies.},

 new-generation simulation code, FLASH. The FLASH code
 solves the fully compressible, reactive hydrodynamic

 the equations of state and thermonuclear reaction networks.
 The FLASH code was developed to study the problems of
 nuclear flashes on the surfaces of neutron stars and white
 dwarfs, as well as in the interior of white dwarfs. We
 expect, however, that the FLASH code will be useful for
 solving a wide variety of other problems. This first
 version of the code has been subjected to a large variety
 of test cases and is currently being used for production
 simulations of X-ray bursts, Rayleigh-Taylor and
 Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities, and thermonuclear flame
 fronts. The FLASH code is portable and already runs on a
 wide variety of massively parallel machines, including some
 of the largest machines now extant.},

  Abstract                 = {(Abridged) We propose a new method to estimate the Bondi
 (hot gas) accretion rates onto the supermassive black holes
 (SMBHs) at the centres of elliptical galaxies. It can be
 applied even if the Bondi radius is not well-resolved in
 X-ray observations. This method is based on two simple
 assumptions: (1) hot gas outside the Bondi radius is in
 nearly a hydrostatic equilibrium in a gravitational
 potential, and (2) the gas temperature near the galaxy
 centre is close to the virial temperature of the galaxy. We
 apply this method to 28 bright elliptical galaxies in
 nearby galaxy clusters (27 of them are the brightest
 cluster galaxies; BCGs). We find a strong correlation
 between the Bondi accretion rates and the power of jets
 associated with the SMBHs. For most galaxies, the accretion
 rates are large enough to account for the jet powers. Our
 results indicate that hot gas in the elliptical galaxies
 directly controls the feedback from the active galactic
 nuclei (AGN), which leads to a stable heating of the
 cluster cool cores. We also find that more massive SMBHs in
 BCGs tend to have larger specific growth rates. This may
 explain the hyper masses (~10^10 Msun) of some of the
 SMBHs. Comparison between the accretion rates and the X-ray
 luminosities of the AGN suggests that the AGN in the BCGs
 are extremely radiatively inefficient compared with X-ray
 binaries in the Milky Way. Lastly, we find a tight
 correlation between the Bondi accretion rates and the X-ray
 luminosities of cool cores. Their relation is nearly linear
 and the power generated by the Bondi accretion is large
 enough to compensate the radiative cooling of the cool
 cores. The results of this study demonstrate that the AGN
 feedback associated with Bondi accretion is essential to
 suppress cooling flows in clusters.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the tidal excitation of gravity modes (g-modes)
 in compact white dwarf binary systems with periods ranging
 from minutes to hours. As the orbit of the system decays
 via gravitational radiation, the orbital frequency
 increases and sweeps through a series of resonances with
 the g-modes of the white dwarf. At each resonance, the
 tidal force excites the g-mode to a relatively large
 amplitude, transferring the orbital energy to the stellar
 oscillation. We calculate the eigenfrequencies of g-modes
 and their coupling coefficients with the tidal field for
 realistic non-rotating white dwarf models. Using these mode
 properties, we numerically compute the excited mode
 amplitude in the linear approximation as the orbit passes
 though the resonance, including the back reaction of the
 mode on the orbit. We also derive analytical estimates for
 the mode amplitude and the duration of the resonance, which
 accurately reproduce our numerical results for most binary
 parameters. We find that the g-modes can be excited to a
 dimensionless (mass-weighted) amplitude up to 0.1, with the
 mode energy approaching 10-3 of the gravitational binding
 energy of the star. Therefore the low-frequency (â‰²10-2
 Hz) gravitational waveforms produced by the binaries,
 detectable by LISA, are strongly affected by the tidal
 resonances. Our results also suggest that thousands of
 years prior to the binary merger, the white dwarf may be
 heated up significantly by tidal interactions. However,
 more study is needed since the physical amplitudes of the
 excited oscillation modes become highly non-linear in the
 outer layer of the star, which can reduce the mode
 amplitude attained by tidal excitation.},

  Abstract                 = {We complete the census of nuclear X-ray activity in 100
 early-type Virgo galaxies observed by the Chandra X-ray
 Telescope as part of the AMUSE-Virgo survey, down to a
 (3sigma) limiting luminosity of 3.7 Ã— 1038 erg s-1 over
 0.5-7 keV. The stellar mass distribution of the targeted
 sample, which is mostly composed of formally "inactive"
 galaxies, peaks below 1010 M sun, a regime where the very
 existence of nuclear supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is
 debated. Out of 100 objects, 32 show a nuclear X-ray
 source, including 6 hybrid nuclei which also host a massive
 nuclear cluster as visible from archival Hubble Space
 Telescope images. After carefully accounting for
 contamination from nuclear low-mass X-ray binaries based on
 the shape and normalization of their X-ray luminosity
 function (XLF), we conclude that between 24% and 34% of the
 galaxies in our sample host an X-ray active SMBH (at the
 95% confidence level). This sets a firm lower limit to the
 black hole (BH) occupation fraction in nearby bulges within
 a cluster environment. The differential logarithmic XLF of
 active SMBHs scales with the X-ray luminosity as L X
 -0.4$\pm$0.1 up to 1042 erg s-1. At face value, the active
 fraction---down to our luminosity limit---is found to
 increase with host stellar mass. However, taking into
 account selection effects, we find that the average
 Eddington-scaled X-ray luminosity scales with BH mass as M
 BH ^{-0.62^{+0.13}_{-0.12}}, with an intrinsic scatter of
 0.46+0.08 -0.06 dex. This finding can be interpreted as
 observational evidence for "down-sizing" of BH accretion in
 local early types, that is, low-mass BHs shine relatively
 closer to their Eddington limit than higher mass objects.
 As a consequence, the fraction of active galaxies, defined
 as those above a fixed X-ray Eddington ratio, decreases
 with increasing BH mass.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on two-dimensional high-resolution hydrodynamic numerical simulation, we study the mechanical and radiative feedback effects from the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) on the cosmological evolution of an isolated elliptical galaxy. The inner boundary of the simulation domain is carefully chosen so that the fiducial Bondi radius is resolved and the accretion rate of the black hole is determined self-consistently. It is well known that when the accretion rates are high and low, the central AGNs will be in cold and hot accretion modes, which correspond to the radiative and kinetic feedback modes, respectively. The emitted spectrum from the hot accretion flows is harder than that from the cold accretion flows, which could result in a higher Compton temperature accompanied by a more efficient radiative heating, according to previous theoretical works. Such a difference of the Compton temperature between the two feedback modes, the focus of this study, has been neglected in previous works. Significant differences in the kinetic feedback mode are found as a result of the stronger Compton heating. More importantly, if we constrain models to correctly predict black hole growth and AGN duty cycle after cosmological evolution, we find that the favored model parameters are constrained: mechanical feedback efficiency diminishes with decreasing luminosity (the maximum efficiency being ~= 10-3.5), and X-ray Compton temperature increases with decreasing luminosity, although models with fixed mechanical efficiency and Compton temperature can be found that are satisfactory as well. We conclude that radiative feedback in the kinetic mode is much more important than previously thought.},

  Abstract                 = {The fueling of black holes is one key problem in the
 evolution of baryons in the universe. Chaotic cold
 accretion (CCA) profoundly differs from classic accretion
 models, as Bondi and thin disc theories. Using 3D
 high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations, we now probe the
 impact of rotation on the hot and cold accretion flow in a
 typical massive galaxy. In the hot mode, with or without
 turbulence, the pressure-dominated flow forms a
 geometrically thick rotational barrier, suppressing the
 black hole accretion rate to ~1/3 of the spherical case
 value. When radiative cooling is dominant, the gas loses
 pressure support and quickly circularizes in a cold thin
 disk; the accretion rate is decoupled from the cooling
 rate, although it is higher than that of the hot mode. In
 the more common state of a turbulent and heated atmosphere,
 CCA drives the dynamics if the gas velocity dispersion
 exceeds the rotational velocity, i.e., turbulent Taylor
 number Tat< 1. Extended multiphase filaments condense out
 of the hot phase via thermal instability (TI) and rain
 toward the black hole, boosting the accretion rate up to
 100 times the Bondi rate (M* ~ Mcool). Initially,
 turbulence broadens the angular momentum distribution of
 the hot gas, allowing the cold phase to condense with
 prograde or retrograde motion. Subsequent chaotic
 collisions between the cold filaments, clouds, and a clumpy
 variable torus promote the cancellation of angular
 momentum, leading to high accretion rates. As turbulence
 weakens (Tat > 1), the broadening of the distribution and
 the efficiency of collisions diminish, damping the
 accretion rate âˆ Tat-1, until the cold disk drives the
 dynamics. This is exacerbated by the increased difficulty
 to grow TI in a rotating halo. The simulated sub-Eddington
 accretion rates cover the range inferred from AGN cavity
 observations. CCA predicts inner flat X-ray temperature and
 r-1 density profiles, as recently discovered in M 87 and
 NGC 3115. The synthetic Halpha images reproduce the main
 features of cold gas observations in massive ellipticals,
 as the line fluxes and the filaments versus disk
 morphology. Such dichotomy is key for the long-term AGN
 feedback cycle. As gas cools, filamentary CCA develops and
 boosts AGN heating; the cold mode is thus reduced and the
 rotating disk remains the sole cold structure. Its
 consumption leaves the atmosphere in hot mode with
 suppressed accretion and feedback, reloading the cycle.},

  Abstract                 = {Bondi theory is often assumed to adequately describe the
 mode of accretion in astrophysical environments. However,
 the Bondi flow must be adiabatic, spherically symmetric,
 steady, unperturbed, with constant boundary conditions.
 Using 3D adaptive mesh refinement simulations, linking the
 50 kpc to the sub-parsec (sub-pc) scales over the course of
 40 Myr, we systematically relax the classic assumptions in
 a typical galaxy hosting a supermassive black hole. In the
 more realistic scenario, where the hot gas is cooling,
 while heated and stirred on large scales, the accretion
 rate is boosted up to two orders of magnitude compared with
 the Bondi prediction. The cause is the non-linear growth of
 thermal instabilities, leading to the condensation of cold
 clouds and filaments when tcool/tff â‰² 10. The clouds
 decouple from the hot gas, `raining' on to the centre.
 Subsonic turbulence of just over 100 km s-1 (M > 0.2)
 induces the formation of thermal instabilities, even in the
 absence of heating, while in the transonic regime turbulent
 dissipation inhibits their growth (tturb/tcool â‰² 1). When
 heating restores global thermodynamic balance, the
 formation of the multiphase medium is violent, and the mode
 of accretion is fully cold and chaotic. The recurrent
 collisions and tidal forces between clouds, filaments and
 the central clumpy torus promote angular momentum
 cancellation, hence boosting accretion. On sub-pc scales
 the clouds are channelled to the very centre via a funnel.
 In this study, we do not inject a fixed initial angular
 momentum, though vorticity is later seeded by turbulence. A
 good approximation to the accretion rate is the cooling
 rate, which can be used as subgrid model, physically
 reproducing the boost factor of 100 required by
 cosmological simulations, while accounting for the frequent
 fluctuations. Since our modelling is fairly general
 (turbulence/heating due to AGN feedback, galaxy motions,
 mergers, stellar evolution), chaotic cold accretion may be
 common in many systems, such as hot galactic haloes, groups
 and clusters. In this mode, the black hole can quickly
 react to the state of the entire host galaxy, leading to
 efficient self-regulated AGN feedback and the symbiotic
 Magorrian relation. Chaotic accretion can generate
 high-velocity clouds, likely leading to strong variations
 in the AGN luminosity, and the deflection or mass-loading
 of jets. During phases of overheating, the hot mode becomes
 the single channel of accretion, though strongly suppressed
 by turbulence. High-resolution data could determine the
 current mode of accretion: assuming quiescent feedback, the
 cold mode results in a quasi-flat-temperature core as
 opposed to the cuspy profile of the hot mode.},

  Abstract                 = {Simulations of hot, pressure-supported, tilted black hole
 accretion flows, in which the angular momentum of the flow
 is misaligned with the black hole spin axis, can exhibit
 two nonaxisymmetric shock structures in the inner regions
 of the flow. We analyze the strength and significance of
 these shock structures in simulations with tilt angles of
 10$\,^{\circ}$ and 15$\,^{\circ}$. By integrating fluid
 trajectories in the simulations through the shocks and
 tracking the variations of fluid quantities along these
 trajectories, we show that these shocks are strong, with
 substantial compression ratios, in contrast to earlier
 claims. However, they are only moderately relativistic. We
 also show that the two density enhancements resembling flow
 streams in their shape are in fact merely post-shock
 compressions, as fluid trajectories cut across, rather than
 flow along, them. The dissipation associated with the
 shocks is a substantial fraction (sime 3%-12%) of the rest
 mass energy advected into the hole, and therefore
 comparable to the dissipation expected from turbulence. The
 shocks should therefore make order unity changes in the
 observed properties of black hole accretion flows that are
 tilted.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a new spectral signature for supermassive black
 hole binaries (SMBHBs) with circumbinary gas discs: a sharp
 drop in flux bluewards of the Lyman limit. A prominent edge
 is produced if the gas dominating the emission in the Lyman
 continuum region of the spectrum is sufficiently cold (T
 â‰² 20 000 K) to contain significant neutral hydrogen.
 Circumbinary discs may be in this regime if the binary
 torques open a central cavity in the disc and clear most of
 the hot gas from the inner region, and if any residual UV
 emission from the individual BHs is either dim or
 intermittent. We model the vertical structure and spectra
 of circumbinary discs using the radiative transfer code
 TLUSTY, and identify the range of BH masses and binary
 separations producing a Lyman edge. We find that compact
 supermassive (M â‰³ 108 M&sun;) binaries with orbital
 periods of Ëœ0.1-10 yr, whose gravitational waves are
 expected to be detectable by pulsar timing arrays, could
 have prominent Lyman edges. Such strong spectral edge
 features are not typically present in AGN spectra and could
 serve as corroborating evidence for the presence of an
 SMBHB.},

 profiles of hot gas in slowly accreting (`quiescent')
 galactic nuclei for a range of central black hole masses
 M*, parametrized gas heating rates, and observationally
 motivated stellar density profiles. Mass is supplied to the
 circumnuclear medium by stellar winds, while energy is
 injected primarily by stellar winds, supernovae, and black
 hole feedback. Analytic estimates are derived for the
 stagnation radius (where the radial velocity of the gas
 passes through zero) and the large-scale gas inflow rate,
 dot{M}, as a function of M* and the gas heating efficiency,
 the latter being related to the star formation history. We
 assess the conditions under which radiative instabilities
 develop in the hydrostatic region near the stagnation
 radius, both in the case of a single burst of star
 formation and for the average star formation history
 predicted by cosmological simulations. By combining a
 sample of measured nuclear X-ray luminosities, LX, of
 nearby quiescent galactic nuclei with our results for
 dot{M}(M_{bullet }), we address whether the nuclei are
 consistent with accreting in a steady state, thermally
 stable manner for radiative efficiencies predicted for
 radiatively inefficiency accretion flows. We find thermally
 stable accretion cannot explain the short average growth
 times of low-mass black holes in the local Universe, which
 must instead result from gas being fed in from large radii,
 due either to gas inflows or thermal instabilities acting
 on larger, galactic scales. Our results have implications
 for attempts to constrain the occupation fraction of
 upermassive black holes in low-mass galaxies using the mean
 LX-M* correlation, as well as the predicted diversity of
 the circumnuclear densities encountered by relativistic
 outflows from tidal disruption events.},

  Abstract                 = {A large population of X-ray binaries (XRBs) was recently discovered within the central parsec of the Galaxy by Hailey et al. While the presence of compact objects on this scale due to radial mass segregation is, in itself, unsurprising, the fraction of binaries would naively be expected to be small because of how easily primordial binaries are dissociated in the dynamically hot environment of the nuclear star cluster (NSC). We propose that the formation of XRBs in the central parsec is dominated by the tidal capture of stars by black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs). We model the time-dependent radial density profiles of stars and compact objects in the NSC with a Fokker-Planck approach, using the present-day stellar population and rate of in situ massive star (and thus compact object) formation as observational constraints. Of the ?1-4 × 104 BHs that accumulate in the central parsec over the age of the Galaxy, we predict that ?60-200 currently exist as BH-XRBs formed from tidal capture, consistent with the population seen by Hailey et al. A somewhat lower number of tidal capture NS-XRBs is also predicted. We also use our observationally calibrated models for the NSC to predict rates of other exotic dynamical processes, such as the tidal disruption of stars by the central supermassive BH (?10-4 per year at z = 0).},

  Abstract                 = {We discuss constraints on the properties and nature of the dark mass concentration at the core of the Milky Way. We present 0.15-arcsec astrometric K-band maps in five epochs beween 1992 and 1996. From these we derive imposed stellar proper motions within 3 arcsec of the compact radio source SgrA* whose infrared counterpart may have been detected, for the first time, in a deep image in 1996 June. We also report lambda/Deltalambda~35 speckle spectroscopy and show that several of the SgrA* (infrared) cluster members are likely early-type stars of mass ~15 to 20 Msolar. All available checks, including a first comparison with high-resolution maps that are now becoming available from other groups, support our previous conclusion that there are several fast-moving stars (>=10^3 km s^-1) in the immediate vicinity (0.01 pc) of SgrA*. From the stellar radial and proper motion data, we infer that a dark mass of 2.61 (+/-0.15_stat)(+/-0.35_stat+sys)x10^6 Msolar must reside within about one light-week of the compact radio source. Its density must be 2.2x10^12 Msolar pc^-3 or greater. There is no stable configuration of normal stars, stellar remnants or substellar entities at that density. From an equipartition argument we infer that at least 5 per cent of the dark mass (>=10^5 Msolar) is associated with the compact radio source SgrA* itself and is concentrated on a scale of less than 15 times the Schwarzschild radius of a 2.6x10^6-Msolar black hole. The corresponding density is 3x10^20 Msolar pc^-3 or greater. If one accepts these arguments it is hard to escape the conclusion that there must be a massive black hole at the core of the Milky Way.},

 large-scale Galactic bulge but shows an excess of stars at
 Ks<=14. It fits population synthesis models of an old,
 metal-rich stellar population with a contribution from
 young, early, and late-type stars at the bright end. In
 contrast, the cusp within <=1.5" of Sgr A* appears to have
 a featureless luminosity function, suggesting that old,
 low-mass, horizontal-branch/red-clump stars are lacking.
 Likewise, there appear to be fewer late-type giants. The
 innermost cusp also contains a group of moderately bright,
 early-type stars that are tightly bound to the black hole.
 We interpret these results as evidence that the stellar
 properties change significantly from the outer cluster (>=a
 few arcseconds) to the dense innermost region around the
 black hole. We find that most of the massive early-type
 stars at distances of 1"-10" from Sgr A* are located in two
 rotating and geometrically thin disks. These disks are
 inclined at large angles and counterrotate with respect to
 each other. Their stellar content is essentially the same,
 indicating that they formed at the same time. We conclude
 that of the possible formation scenarios for these massive
 stars the most probable one is that 5-8 million years ago
 two clouds fell into the center, collided, were shock
 compressed, and then formed two rotating (accretion) disks
 orbiting the central black hole. For the OB stars in the
 central arcsecond, on the other hand, a stellar merger
 model is the most appealing explanation. These stars may
 thus be ``super-blue stragglers,'' formed and
 ``rejuvenated'' through mergers of lower mass stars in the
 very dense (>=108 Msolar pc-3) environment of the cusp. The
 ``collider model'' also accounts for the lack of giants
 within the central few arcseconds. The star closest to Sgr
 A* in 2002, S2, exhibits a 3.8 mum excess. We propose that
 the mid-IR emission comes either from the accretion flow
 around the black hole itself or from dust in the accretion
 flow that is heated by the ultraviolet emission of S2.},

  Abstract                 = {We report Ëœ1" resolution K-band (2 mum) imaging
 spectroscopy of the central parsec of our Galaxy. The
 derived radial velocities for 223 early- and late-type
 stars probe the nuclear mass distribution to spatial scales
 of 0.1 pc. We find a statistically very significant
 increase of projected stellar velocity dispersion from
 about 55 km s-1 at p Ëœ5 pc to 180 km s-1 at p Ëœ0.1 pc.
 The stars are also rotating about the dynamic center. The
 late-type stars follow general Galactic rotation, while the
 early-type stars show counter-rotation. Fitting
 simultaneously the observed projected surface densities and
 velocity dispersions, we derive the intrinsic volume
 densities and radial velocity dispersions as a function of
 distance from the dynamic center for both types of stars.
 We then derive the mass distribution between 0.1 and 5 pc
 from the Jeans equation assuming an isotropic velocity
 field. Our analysis requires a compact central dark mass of
 2.5-3.2 x 106 Msun, at 6-8 sigma significance. The dark
 mass has a density of 109 Msun pc-3 or greater and a mass
 to 2 mum luminosity of >= 100. The increase in
 mass-to-luminosity ratio can be reduced but not eliminated
 even if extreme anisotropic velocity distributions are
 considered. The dark mass cannot be a cluster of solar mass
 remnants (such as neutron stars). It is either a compact
 cluster of 10-20 Msun black holes or a single massive black
 hole.},

 from a homogeneous analysis of all suitable Wide Field

 spread in age. We confirm that most NSCs have sizes similar
 to globular clusters (GCs), but find that the largest and
 brightest NSCs occupy the regime between ultra-compact
 dwarf (UCD) and the nuclei of early-type galaxies in the
 size-luminosity plane. The overlap in size, mass, and
 colour between the different incarnations of compact
 stellar systems provides a support for the notion that at
 least some UCDs and the most massive Galactic GCs may be
 remnant nuclei of disrupted disc galaxies. We find
 tentative evidence for the NSCs' reff to be smaller when
 measured in bluer filters and discuss possible implications
 of this result. We also highlight a few examples of complex
 nuclear morphologies, including double nuclei, extended
 stellar structures, and nuclear F606W excess from either
 recent (circum-)nuclear star formation and/or a weak active
 galactic nucleus. Such examples may serve as case studies
 for ongoing NSC evolution via the two main suggested

 formation.},

  Abstract                 = {We present two luminous UV/optical flares from the nuclei
 of apparently inactive early-type galaxies at z = 0.37 and
 0.33 that have the radiative properties of a flare from the
 tidal disruption of a star. In this paper we report the
 second candidate tidal disruption event discovery in the UV
 by the GALEX Deep Imaging Survey and present simultaneous
 optical light curves from the CFHTLS Deep Imaging Survey
 for both UV flares. The first few months of the UV/optical
 light curves are well fitted with the canonical t-5/3
 power-law decay predicted for emission from the fallback of
 debris from a tidally disrupted star. Chandra ACIS X-ray
 observations during the flares detect soft X-ray sources
 with Tbb = (2--5) Ã— 105 K or Gamma > 3 and place limits on
 hard X-ray emission from an underlying AGN down to LX(2--10
 keV) lesssim 1041 ergs s-1. Blackbody fits to the
 UV/optical spectral energy distributions of the flares
 indicate peak flare luminosities of gtrsim1044-1045 ergs
 s-1. The temperature, luminosity, and light curves of both
 flares are in excellent agreement with emission from a
 tidally disrupted main-sequence star onto a central black
 hole of several times 107 Mâ˜‰. The observed detection rate
 of our search over ~2.9 deg2 of GALEX Deep Imaging Survey
 data spanning from 2003 to 2007 is consistent with tidal
 disruption rates calculated from dynamical models, and we
 use these models to make predictions for the detection

  Abstract                 = {The flare of radiation from the tidal disruption and
 accretion of a star can be used as a marker for
 supermassive black holes that otherwise lie dormant and
 undetected in the centres of distant galaxies. Previous
 candidate flares have had declining light curves in good
 agreement with expectations, but with poor constraints on
 the time of disruption and the type of star disrupted,
 because the rising emission was not observed. Recently, two
 `relativistic' candidate tidal disruption events were
 discovered, each of whose extreme X-ray luminosity and
 synchrotron radio emission were interpreted as the onset of
 emission from a relativistic jet. Here we report a luminous
 ultraviolet-optical flare from the nuclear region of an
 inactive galaxy at a redshift of 0.1696. The observed
 continuum is cooler than expected for a simple accreting
 debris disk, but the well-sampled rise and decay of the
 light curve follow the predicted mass accretion rate and
 can be modelled to determine the time of disruption to an
 accuracy of two days. The black hole has a mass of about
 two million solar masses, modulo a factor dependent on the
 mass and radius of the star disrupted. On the basis of the
 spectroscopic signature of ionized helium from the unbound
 debris, we determine that the disrupted star was a
 helium-rich stellar core.},

  Abstract                 = {A dormant supermassive black hole lurking in the center of
 a galaxy will be revealed when a star passes close enough
 to be torn apart by tidal forces, and a flare of
 electromagnetic radiation is emitted when the bound
 fraction of the stellar debris falls back onto the black
 hole and is accreted. Although the tidal disruption of a
 star is a rare event in a galaxy, â‰ˆ10-4 yr-1,
 observational candidates have emerged in all-sky X-ray and
 deep ultraviolet (UV) surveys in the form of luminous
 UV/X-ray flares from otherwise quiescent galaxies. Here we
 present the third candidate tidal disruption event
 discovered in the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) Deep
 Imaging Survey: a 1.6 Ã— 1043 erg s-1 UV/optical flare from
 a star-forming galaxy at z = 0.1855. The UV/optical
 spectral energy distribution (SED) during the peak of the
 flare measured by GALEX and Palomar Large Field Camera
 imaging can be modeled as a single temperature blackbody
 with T bb = 1.7 Ã— 105 K and a bolometric luminosity of 3
 Ã— 1045 erg s-1, assuming an internal extinction with E(B -
 V)gas = 0.3. The Chandra upper limit on the X-ray
 luminosity during the peak of the flare, LX (2 - 10
 keV)<1041 erg s-1, is 2 orders of magnitude fainter than
 expected from the ratios of UV to X-ray flux density
 observed in active galaxies. We compare the light curves
 and broadband properties of all three tidal disruption
 candidates discovered by GALEX, and find that (1) the light
 curves are well fitted by the power-law decline expected
 for the fallback of debris from a tidally disrupted
 solar-type star and (2) the UV/optical SEDs can be
 attributed to thermal emission from an envelope of debris
 located at roughly 10 times the tidal disruption radius of
 a â‰ˆ107 M sun central black hole. We use the observed peak
 absolute optical magnitudes of the flares (-17.5>Mg > -
 18.9) to predict the detection capabilities of upcoming
 optical synoptic surveys.},

 by the stream of stellar debris that plunges into the black

 black holes that can also produce flares, a convincing
 demonstration that a stellar tidal disruption has occurred
 generally begins with a ``normal'' galaxy that has no
 evidence of prior nuclear activity. Here we report a
 luminous UV flare from an elliptical galaxy at z=0.37 in
 the Groth field of the GALEX Deep Imaging Survey that has
 no evidence of a Seyfert nucleus from optical spectroscopy
 and X-ray imaging obtained during the flare.
 Multiwavelength data collected at the time of the event,
 and for 2 years following, allow us to constrain, for the
 first time, the spectral energy distribution of a candidate
 tidal disruption flare from optical through X-rays. The
 luminosity and temperature of the radiation and the decay
 curve of the flare are in excellent agreement with
 theoretical predictions for the tidal disruption of a star,
 and provide the strongest empirical evidence for a stellar
 disruption event to date.},

  Abstract                 = {We have obtained the first detection of spectral absorption lines in one of the high-velocity stars in the vicinity of the Galaxy's central supermassive black hole. Both Br? (2.1661 ?m) and He I (2.1126 ?m) are seen in absorption in S0-2 with equivalent widths (2.8+/-0.3 and 1.7+/-0.4 Å) and an inferred stellar rotational velocity (220+/-40 km s-1) that are consistent with that of an O8-B0 dwarf, which suggests that it is a massive (~15 Msolar) young (less than 10 Myr) main-sequence star. This presents a major challenge to star formation theories, given the strong tidal forces that prevail over all distances reached by S0-2 in its current orbit (130-1900 AU) and the difficulty in migrating this star inward during its lifetime from farther out where tidal forces should no longer preclude star formation. The radial velocity measurements (z>=-510+/-40 km s-1) and our reported proper motions for S0-2 strongly constrain its orbit, providing a direct measure of the black hole mass of 4.1(+/-0.6)×106(R0/8 kpc)3 Msolar. The Keplerian orbit parameters have uncertainties that are reduced by a factor of 2-3 compared to previously reported values and include, for the first time, an independent solution for the dynamical center; this location, while consistent with the nominal infrared position of Sgr A*, is localized to a factor of 5 more precisely (+/-2 mas). Furthermore, the ambiguity in the inclination of the orbit is resolved with the addition of the radial velocity measurement, indicating that the star is behind the black hole at the time of closest approach and counterrevolving against the Galaxy. With further radial velocity measurements in the next few years, the orbit of S0-2 will provide the most robust estimate of the distance to the Galactic center.},

The K-band images obtained in 1995 June, 1996 June, and 1997 May have the highest angular resolution obtained at near-infrared wavelengths from ground or space (?res = 0.05" = 0.002 pc) and reveal a large population of faint stars. We use an unbiased approach for identifying and selecting stars to be included in this proper-motion study, which results in a sample of 90 stars with brightness ranging from K = 9-17 mag and two-dimensional velocities as large as 1400 +/- 100 km s-1. Compared to earlier work (Eckart et al. 1997; Genzel et al. 1997), the source confusion is reduced by a factor of 9, the number of stars with proper-motion measurement in the central 25 arcsec2 of our Galaxy is doubled, and the accuracy of the velocity measurements in the central 1 arcsec2 is improved by a factor of 4. The peaks of both the stellar surface density and the velocity dispersion are consistent with the position of the unusual radio source and black hole candidate Sgr A*, which suggests that Sgr A* is coincident (+/-0.1") with the dynamical center of the Galaxy. As a function of distance from Sgr A*, the velocity dispersion displays a falloff well-fitted by Keplerian motion (?v ~ r-0.5+/-0.1) about a central dark mass of 2.6 +/- 0.2 × 106 M? confined to a volume of at most 10-6 pc3, which is consistent with earlier results. Although uncertainties in the measurements mathematically allow for the matter to be distributed over this volume as a cluster, no realistic cluster is physically tenable. Thus, independent of the presence of Sgr A*, the large inferred central density of at least 1012 M? pc-3, which exceeds the volume-averaged mass densities found at the center of any other galaxy, leads us to the conclusion that our Galaxy harbors a massive central black hole.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent measurements of the velocities of stars near the centre of the Milky Way have provided the strongest evidence for the presence of a supermassive black hole in a galaxy, but the observational uncertainties poorly constrain many of the black hole's properties. Determining the accelerations of stars in their orbits around the centre provides much more precise information about the position and mass of the black hole. Here we report measurements of the accelerations of three stars located ~0.005pc (projected on the sky) from the central radio source Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*); these accelerations are comparable to those experienced by the Earth as it orbits the Sun. These data increase the inferred minimum mass density in the central region of the Galaxy by an order of magnitude relative to previous results, and localize the dark mass to within 0.05 +/- 0.04arcsec of the nominal position of Sgr A*. In addition, the orbital period of one of the observed stars could be as short as 15 years, allowing us the opportunity in the near future to observe an entire period.},

  Abstract                 = {We revisit the hypothesis that dense galactic nuclei are
 formed from inspiraling globular clusters. Recent advances
 in the understanding of the continuous formation of
 globular clusters over cosmic time and the concurrent
 evolution of the galaxy stellar distribution allow us to
 construct a simple model that matches the observed spatial
 and mass distributions of clusters in the Galaxy and the
 giant elliptical galaxy M87. In order to compare with
 observations, we model the effects of dynamical friction
 and dynamical evolution, including stellar mass loss, tidal
 stripping of stars, and tidal disruption of clusters by the
 growing galactic nucleus. We find that inspiraling globular
 clusters form a dense central structure, with mass and
 radius comparable to the typical values in observed nuclear
 star clusters (NSCs) in late-type and low-mass early-type
 galaxies. The density contrast associated with the NSC is
 less pronounced in giant elliptical galaxies. Our results
 indicate that the NSC mass as a fraction of mass of the
 galaxy stellar spheroid scales as M_{NSC}/{M_{*}}â‰ˆ 0.0025
 {M_{*}}_{,11}^{-0.5}. Thus disrupted globular clusters
 could contribute most of the mass of NSCs in galaxies with
 stellar mass below 1011 M &sun;. The inner part of the
 accumulated cluster may seed the growth of a central black
 hole via stellar dynamical core collapse, thereby relieving
 the problem of how to form luminous quasars at high
 redshift. The seed black hole may reach ~105 M &sun; within
 <~ 1 Gyr of the beginning of globular cluster formation.},

  Abstract                 = {The Kuiper belt is a disk of icy bodies that orbit the Sun beyond Neptune; the largest known members are Pluto and its companion Charon. A few per cent of Kuiper-belt bodies have recently been found to be binaries with wide separations and mass ratios of the order of unity. Collisions were too infrequent to account for the observed number of binaries, implying that these binaries formed through collisionless interactions mediated by gravity. These interactions are likely to have been most effective during the period of runaway accretion, early in the Solar System's history. Here we show that a transient binary forms when two large bodies penetrate one another's Hill sphere (the region where their mutual forces are larger than the tidal force of the Sun). The loss of energy needed to stabilize the binary orbit can then occur either through dynamical friction from surrounding small bodies, or through the gravitational scattering of a third large body. Our estimates slightly favour the former mechanism. We predict that five per cent of Kuiper-belt objects are binaries with apparent separations greater than 0.2arcsec, and that most are in tighter binaries or systems of higher multiplicity.},

The results suggest that the tidal torque on an early-type star is concentrated near the boundary between the convective core and the radiative envelope, and that a train of gravity waves which is excited at this boundary outwardly transports the angular momentum removed from the fluid by the torque. Tidal despinning to synchronous rotation is shown to proceed from the outside to the inside of the star. The present model can account for the previous finding that Zahn's (1975, 1977) theory for tidal evolution in early-type close binaries is compatible with the observed rates of orbit circularization, while significantly underestimating the observed rates of spin synchronization.},

 The results show that: (1) the external potential exerts
 torques on the disk only at the Lindblad and corotation
 resonances; (2) the torque is positive at the outer
 Lindblad resonance and negative at the inner Lindblad
 resonance; (3) the torque at corotation has the sign of the
 radial vorticity gradient; and (4) the torques are of the
 same order of magnitude at both types of resonance and
 independent of the speed of sound in the disk. It is found
 that the external potential also excites density waves in
 the vicinity of the Lindblad and corotation resonances,
 that the long trailing wave is excited at a Lindblad
 resonance, and that short trailing waves are excited at the
 corotation resonance. The behavior of particle disks is
 briefly discussed, and the external torques on particle
 disks are proven to be identical to those on gas disks},

  Abstract                 = {The outer parts of standard steady-state accretion discs
 around quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) are prone to
 self-gravity, and they might be expected to fragment into
 stars rather than feed the central black hole. Possible
 solutions to this well-known problem are examined with an
 emphasis on general dynamic constraints. Irradiation by the
 QSO is insufficient for stability even if the outer disc is
 strongly warped. Marginal local gravitational instability
 enhances viscous transport but extends the stable regions
 only modestly. Compton cooling in the observed QSO
 radiation field rules out hot thick discs unless the local
 accretion rate is vastly super-Eddington. The formation of
 stars or stellar-mass black holes, and the release of
 energy in these objects by fusion or accretion, may help to
 stabilize the remaining gas in an otherwise standard disc.
 But at fixed mass accretion rate, the energy inputs
 required for stability increase with radius; beyond a
 parsec, they approach the total QSO luminosity and are
 probably unsustainable by stars. Magnetic torques from a
 wind or corona, and gravitational torques from bars or
 global spirals, may increase the accretion speed and reduce
 the density of the disc. But dynamical arguments suggest
 that the accretion speed is at most sonic, so that
 instability still sets in beyond about a parsec.
 Alternatively, the QSO could be fed by stellar collisions
 in a very dense stellar cluster, but the velocity
 dispersion would have to be much higher than observed in
 nearby galactic nuclei containing quiescent black holes. In
 view of these difficulties, we suggest that QSO discs do
 not extend beyond a thousand Schwarzschild radii or so.
 Then they must be frequently replenished with gas of small
 specific angular momentum.},

 usually attributed to turbulent convection, while that of
 early-type binaries is explained by resonant excitation of
 g-modes. We show that the latter mechanism also operates in
 solar-type stars and is at least as effective as convection
 despite inefficient damping of g-modes in the radiative
 core. The maximum period at which this mechanism can
 circularize a binary composed of solar-type stars in 1010
 yr is as low as 3 days, if the modes are damped by
 radiative diffusion only and g-mode resonances are fixed,
 or as high as 6 days if one allows for evolution of the
 resonances and for nonlinear damping near inner turning
 points. Even the larger theoretical period falls short of
 the observed transition period by a factor of 2.},

  Abstract                 = {In large spheroidal stellar systems, such as elliptical
 galaxies, one invariably finds a 106-109Msolar supermassive
 black hole at their centre. In contrast, within dwarf
 elliptical galaxies one predominantly observes a
 105-107Msolar nuclear star cluster. To date, few galaxies
 have been found with both types of nuclei coexisting and
 even less have had the masses determined for both central
 components. Here, we identify one dozen galaxies housing
 nuclear star clusters and supermassive black holes whose
 masses have been measured. This doubles the known number of
 such hermaphrodite nuclei - which are expected to be
 fruitful sources of gravitational radiation. Over the host
 spheroid (stellar) mass range 108-1011Msolar, we find that
 a galaxy's nucleus-to-spheroid (baryon) mass ratio is not a
 constant value but decreases from a few per cent to ~0.3
 per cent such that log[(MBH + MNC)/Msph] = -(0.39 +/- 0.07)
 log[Msph/1010Msolar] - (2.18 +/- 0.07). Once dry merging
 commences and the nuclear star clusters disappear, this
 ratio is expected to become a constant value. As a
 byproduct of our investigation, we have found that the
 projected flux from resolved nuclear star clusters is well
 approximated with S{\'e}rsic functions having a range of
 indices from ~0.5 to ~3, the latter index describing the
 Milky Way's nuclear star cluster.},

  Abstract                 = {Gamma-ray burst afterglows are well described by synchrotron emission from relativistic blast waves expanding into an external medium. The blast wave is believed to amplify the magnetic field and accelerate the electrons into a power-law distribution of energies promptly behind the shock. These electrons then cool both adiabatically and by emitting synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation. The resulting spectra are known to consist of several power-law segments, which smoothly join at certain break frequencies. Here, we give a complete description of all possible spectra under those assumptions and find that there are five possible regimes, depending on the ordering of the break frequencies. The flux density is calculated by integrating over all of the contributions to a given photon arrival time from all of the shocked region using the Blandford & McKee solution. This allows us to calculate more accurate expressions for the value of these break frequencies and describe the shape of the spectral breaks around them. This also provides the shape of breaks in the light curves caused by the passage of a break frequency through the observed band. These new, more exact, estimates are different from more simple calculations by typically a factor of a few, and they describe some new regimes that were previously ignored.},

  Abstract                 = {Using a method to discover and classify supernovae (SNe)
 in galaxy spectra, we detect 91 Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) and 16
 Type II SNe (SNe II) among Ëœ740 000 galaxies of all types
 and Ëœ215 000 star-forming galaxies without active galactic
 nuclei, respectively, in Data Release 9 of the Sloan
 Digital Sky Survey. Of these SNe, 15 SNe Ia and eight SNe
 II are new discoveries reported here for the first time. We
 use our SN samples to measure SN rates per unit mass as a
 function of galaxy stellar mass, star-formation rate (SFR),
 and specific SFR (sSFR), as derived by the MPA-JHU Galspec
 pipeline. We show that correlations between SN Ia and SN II
 rates per unit mass and galaxy stellar mass, SFR, and sSFR
 can be explained by a combination of the respective SN
 delay-time distributions (the distributions of times that
 elapse between the formation of a stellar population and
 all ensuing SNe), the ages of the surveyed galaxies, the
 redshifts at which they are observed, and their star
 formation histories. This model was first suggested by
 Kistler et al. for the SN Ia rate-mass correlation, but is
 expanded here to SNe II and to correlations with galaxy SFR
 and sSFR. Finally, we measure a volumetric SN II rate at
 redshift 0.075 of RII, V = 0.621^{+0.197}_{-0.154} (stat)
 ^{+0.024}_{-0.063} (sys) Ã— 10^{-4} yr-1 Mpc-3. Assuming
 that SNe IIP and IIL account for 60 per cent of all
 core-collapse (CC) SNe, the CC SN rate is RCC, V =
 1.04^{+0.33}_{-0.26} (stat) ^{+0.04}_{-0.11} (sys) Ã—

  Abstract                 = {The rate of tidal disruption events (TDEs), {R}{TDE}, is predicted to depend on stellar conditions near the super-massive black hole (SMBH), which are on difficult-to-measure sub-parsec scales. We test whether {R}{TDE} depends on kpc-scale global galaxy properties, which are observable. We concentrate on stellar surface mass density, {{{? }}}{M\star }, and velocity dispersion, {? }v, which correlate with the stellar density and velocity dispersion of the stars around the SMBH. We consider 35 TDE candidates, with and without known X-ray emission. The hosts range from star-forming to quiescent to quiescent with strong Balmer absorption lines. The last (often with post-starburst spectra) are overrepresented in our sample by a factor of {35}-17+21 or {18}-7+8, depending on the strength of the H? absorption line. For a subsample of hosts with homogeneous measurements, {{{? }}}{M\star }={10}9-{10}10 {M}? /{{{kpc}}}2, higher on average than for a volume-weighted control sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies with similar redshifts and stellar masses. This is because (1) most of the TDE hosts here are quiescent galaxies, which tend to have higher {{{? }}}{M\star } than the star-forming galaxies that dominate the control, and (2) the star-forming hosts have higher average {{{? }}}{M\star } than the star-forming control. There is also a weak suggestion that TDE hosts have lower {? }v than for the quiescent control. Assuming that {R}{TDE}\propto {{{? }}}{M\star }? × {? }v? , and applying a statistical model to the TDE hosts and control sample, we estimate \hat{? }=0.9+/- 0.2 and \hat{? }=-1.0+/- 0.6. This is broadly consistent with {R}{TDE} being tied to the dynamical relaxation of stars surrounding the SMBH.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the first measurement of the BH mass function for broad-line active galaxies in the local universe. Using the ~8500 broad-line active galaxies from SDSS DR4, we construct a broad-line luminosity function that agrees very well with the local soft X-ray luminosity function. Using standard virial relations, we then convert observed broad-line luminosities and widths into BH masses. A mass function constructed in this way has the unique capability to probe the mass region <106 Msolar, which, while insignificant in terms of total BH mass density, nevertheless may place important constraints on the mass distribution of seed BHs in the early universe. The characteristic local active BH has a mass of ~107 Msolar radiating at 10% of the Eddington rate. The active fraction is a strong function of BH mass; at both higher and lower masses the active mass function falls more steeply than one would infer from the distribution of bulge luminosity. The deficit of local massive radiating BHs is a well-known phenomenon, while we present the first robust measurement of a decline in the space density of active BHs at low mass.},

  Abstract                 = {The black hole (BH)-bulge correlations have greatly
 influenced the last decade of efforts to understand galaxy
 evolution. Current knowledge of these correlations is
 limited predominantly to high BH masses (M BHgsim108 M sun)
 that can be measured using direct stellar, gas, and maser
 kinematics. These objects, however, do not represent the
 demographics of more typical L < L* galaxies. This study
 transcends prior limitations to probe BHs that are an order
 of magnitude lower in mass, using BH mass measurements
 derived from the dynamics of H2O megamasers in
 circumnuclear disks. The masers trace the Keplerian
 rotation of circumnuclear molecular disks starting at radii
 of a few tenths of a pc from the central BH. Modeling of
 the rotation curves, presented by Kuo et al., yields BH
 masses with exquisite precision. We present stellar
 velocity dispersion measurements for a sample of nine
 megamaser disk galaxies based on long-slit observations
 using the B&C spectrograph on the Dupont telescope and the
 Dual Imaging Spectrograph on the 3.5 m telescope at Apache
 Point. We also perform bulge-to-disk decomposition of a
 subset of five of these galaxies with Sloan Digital Sky
 Survey imaging. The maser galaxies as a group fall below
 the M BH-sigma* relation defined by elliptical galaxies. We
 show, now with very precise BH mass measurements, that the
 low-scatter power-law relation between M BH and sigma* seen
 in elliptical galaxies is not universal. The elliptical
 galaxy M BH-sigma* relation cannot be used to derive the BH
 mass function at low mass or the zero point for active BH
 masses. The processes (perhaps BH self-regulation or minor
 merging) that operate at higher mass have not effectively
 established an M BH-sigma* relation in this low-mass
 regime.},

  Abstract                 = {A new class of ultra-long-duration (more than 10,000 seconds) ?-ray bursts has recently been suggested. They may originate in the explosion of stars with much larger radii than those producing normal long-duration ?-ray bursts or in the tidal disruption of a star. No clear supernova has yet been associated with an ultra-long-duration ?-ray burst. Here we report that a supernova (SN 2011kl) was associated with the ultra-long-duration ?-ray burst GRB 111209A, at a redshift z of 0.677. This supernova is more than three times more luminous than type Ic supernovae associated with long-duration ?-ray bursts, and its spectrum is distinctly different. The slope of the continuum resembles those of super-luminous supernovae, but extends further down into the rest-frame ultraviolet implying a low metal content. The light curve evolves much more rapidly than those of super-luminous supernovae. This combination of high luminosity and low metal-line opacity cannot be reconciled with typical type Ic supernovae, but can be reproduced by a model where extra energy is injected by a strongly magnetized neutron star (a magnetar), which has also been proposed as the explanation for super-luminous supernovae.},

  Abstract                 = {The dynamics of galactic nuclei reflects the presence of
 supermassive black holes (SBHs) in many ways. Single SBHs
 act as sinks, destroying a mass in stars equal to their own
 mass in roughly one relaxation time and forcing nuclei to
 expand. Formation of binary SBHs displaces a mass in stars
 roughly equal to the binary mass, creating low-density
 cores and ejecting hyper-velocity stars. Gravitational
 radiation recoil can eject coalescing binary SBHs from
 nuclei, resulting in offset SBHs and lopsided cores. We
 review recent work on these mechanisms and discuss the
 observable consequences.},

  Abstract                 = {The realization that the total energy of gamma-ray bursts
 (GRBs) is correlated with their jet break angles motivates
 the search for a similar relation between the peak
 luminosity L and the jet break angles, L~?-2. Such a
 relation implies that the GRB luminosity function
 determines the angular distribution. We rederive the GRB
 luminosity function using the BATSE peak flux distribution
 and compare the predicted distribution with the observed
 redshift distribution. The luminosity function can be
 approximated by a broken power law with a break peak
 luminosity of 4.4?051 ergs s-1, a typical jet angle of 0.12
 rad, and a local GRB rate of 0.44h365 Gpc-3 yr-1. The
 angular distribution implied by L~?-2 agrees well with the
 observed one and implies a correction factor to the local
 rate due to beaming of 75+/-25 (instead of 500, as commonly
 used). The inferred overall local GRB rate is 33+/-11h365
 Gpc-3 yr-1. The luminosity function and angle distribution
 obtained within the universal structured jet model, where
 the angular distribution is essentially ~? and hence the
 luminosity function must be ~L-2, deviate from the
 observations at low peak fluxes and, correspondingly, at
 large angles. The corresponding correction factor for the
 universal structure jet is ~20+/-10.},

  Abstract                 = {Main-sequence disruptions of stars by supermassive black
 holes result in the production of an extended,
 geometrically thin debris stream winding repeatedly around
 the black hole. In the absence of black hole spin, in-plane
 relativistic precession causes this stream to intersect
 with itself after a single winding. In this paper we show
 that relativistic precessions arising from black hole spin
 can induce deflections out of the original orbital plane
 that prevent the stream from self-intersecting even after
 many windings. This naturally leads to a ``dark period'' in
 which the flare is not observable for some time, persisting
 for up to a dozen orbital periods of the most bound
 material, which translates to years for disruptions around
 black holes with masses ~ {10}7{M}o . When the stream
 eventually self-intersects, the distance from the black
 hole and the angle at which this collision occurs determine
 the rate of energy dissipation. We find that more-massive
 black holes ({M}{{h}}â‰³ {10}7{M}o ) tend to have more
 violent stream self-intersections, resulting in prompt
 accretion. For these tidal disruption events (TDEs), the
 accretion rate onto the black hole should still closely
 follow the original fallback rate after a fixed delay time
 {t}{delay}, {\dot{M}}{acc}(t+{t}{delay})={\dot{M}}{fb}(t).
 For lower black hole masses ({M}{{h}}â‰² {10}6), we find
 that flares are typically slowed down by about an order of
 magnitude, resulting in the majority of TDEs being
 sub-Eddington at peak. This also implies that current
 searches for TDEs are biased toward prompt flares, with
 slowed flares likely having been unidentified.},

  Abstract                 = {The disruption of stars by supermassive black holes has
 been linked to more than a dozen flares in the cores of
 galaxies out to redshift z ~ 0.4. Modeling these flares
 properly requires a prediction of the rate of mass return
 to the black hole after a disruption. Through
 hydrodynamical simulation, we show that aside from the full
 disruption of a solar mass star at the exact limit where
 the star is destroyed, the common assumptions used to
 estimate \dot{M}(t), the rate of mass return to the black
 hole, are largely invalid. While the analytical
 approximation to tidal disruption predicts that the
 least-centrally concentrated stars and the deepest
 encounters should have more quickly-peaked flares, we find
 that the most-centrally concentrated stars have the
 quickest-peaking flares, and the trend between the time of
 peak and the impact parameter for deeply penetrating
 encounters reverses beyond the critical distance at which
 the star is completely destroyed. We also show that the
 most-centrally concentrated stars produced a characteristic
 drop in \dot{M}(t) shortly after peak when a star is only
 partially disrupted, with the power law index n being as
 extreme as -4 in the months immediately following the peak
 of a flare. Additionally, we find that n asymptotes to ~= -
 2.2 for both low- and high-mass stars for approximately
 half of all stellar disruptions. Both of these results are
 significantly steeper than the typically assumed n = -5/3.
 As these precipitous decay rates are only seen for events
 in which a stellar core survives the disruption, they can
 be used to determine if an observed tidal disruption flare
 produced a surviving remnant. We provide fitting formulae
 for four fundamental quantities of tidal disruption as
 functions of the star's distance to the black hole at
 pericenter and its stellar structure: the total mass lost,
 the time of peak, the accretion rate at peak, and the
 power-law index shortly after peak. These results should be
 taken into consideration when flares arising from tidal
 disruptions are modeled.},

  Abstract                 = {To examine the role of the host galaxy structure in
 fueling nuclear activity, we estimated gas flow rates from
 several kpc down to the inner few 10 pc for seven nearby
 spiral galaxies, selected from the NUclei of GAlaxies
 sample. We calculated gravitational torques from
 near-infrared images and determined gas in/out-flow rates
 as a function of radius and location within the galactic
 disks, based on high angular resolution interferometric
 observations of molecular (CO using Plateau de Bure
 interferometer) and atomic (H I using the Very Large Array)
 gas. The results are compared with kinematic evidence for
 radial gas flows and the dynamical state of the galaxies
 (via resonances) derived from several different methods. We
 show that gravitational torques are very efficient at
 transporting gas from the outer disk all the way into the
 galaxies centers at \~{}100 pc; previously assumed
 dynamical barriers to gas transport, such as the corotation
 resonance of stellar bars, seem to be overcome by
 gravitational torque induced gas flows from other
 nonaxisymmetric structures. The resulting rates of gas mass
 inflow range from 0.01 to 50 M sun yr-1 and are larger for
 the galaxy center than for the outer disk. Our gas flow
 maps show the action of nested bars within larger bars for
 three galaxies. Noncircular streaming motions found in the
 kinematic maps are larger in the center than in the outer
 disk and appear to correlate only loosely with the
 in/out-flow rates as a function of radius. We demonstrate
 that spiral gas disks are very dynamic systems that undergo
 strong radial evolution on timescales of a few rotation
 periods (e.g., 5 Ã— 108 yrs at a radius of 5 kpc), due to
 the effectiveness of gravitational torques in
 redistributing the cold galactic gas.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the number and interaction rates of supermassive
 black holes in galactic bulges as predicted by hierarchical
 models of galaxy formation in which the spheroidal
 components of galaxies are formed by mergers. In bright
 ellipticals, the number of events that can eject a central
 supermassive binary black hole is large. Central binaries
 must therefore merge in less than a Hubble time - otherwise
 there will be too much scatter in the M*-$\sigma$* relation
 and too many off-centre galactic nuclei. We propose that
 binary black holes are able to merge during the major gas
 accretion events that trigger QSO activity in galaxies. If
 this is the case, less than 10 per cent of faint
 ellipticals and 40 per cent of bright ellipticals are
 predicted to harbour binary black holes with near equal
 masses at their centres. This binary may be ejected away
 from the centre of the galaxy or even into intergalactic
 space in up to 20 per cent of the most luminous
 ellipticals. The number of low-mass black holes that can
 interact with the central object is predicted to be a
 strong function of galaxy luminosity. In most faint
 ellipticals, no black holes fall into the centre of the
 galaxy after the last major gas accretion event, but in the
 most luminous ellipticals, an average of 10 low-mass black
 holes interact with the central supermassive object after
 this time. It is expected that stars will be ejected from
 galaxy cores as these low mass ratio binaries harden.
 Multiple black holes in galactic bulges thus provide a
 natural explanation for the strong systematic trends in the
 observed central density profiles of ellipticals as a
 function of luminosity.},

  Abstract                 = {We employ the Chandra Multiwavelength Project (ChaMP) and
 the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to study the fraction
 of X-ray-active galaxies in the field to z = 0.7. We
 utilize spectroscopic redshifts from SDSS and ChaMP, as
 well as photometric redshifts from several SDSS catalogs,
 to compile a Parent sample of more than 100,000 SDSS
 galaxies and nearly 1600 Chandra X-ray detections. Detailed
 ChaMP volume completeness maps allow us to investigate the
 local fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), defined as
 those objects having broadband X-ray luminosities LX (0.5-8
 keV) >=1042 erg s-1, as a function of absolute optical
 magnitude, X-ray luminosity, redshift, mass, and host
 color/morphological type. In five independent samples
 complete in redshift and i-band absolute magnitude, we
 determine the field AGN fraction to be between 0.16% ?
 0.06% (for z <= 0.125 and -18>Mi > - 20) and 3.80% ? 0.92%
 (for z <= 0.7 and Mi < -23). We find excellent agreement
 between our ChaMP/SDSS field AGN fraction and the Chandra
 cluster AGN fraction, for samples restricted to similar
 redshift and absolute magnitude ranges: 1.19% ? 0.11% of
 ChaMP/SDSS field galaxies with 0.05 < z < 0.31 and absolute
 R-band magnitude more luminous than MR < -20 are AGNs. Our
 results are also broadly consistent with measures of the
 field AGN fraction in narrow, deep fields, though
 differences in the optical selection criteria, redshift
 coverage, and possible cosmic variance between fields
 introduce larger uncertainties in these comparisons.},

  abstract      = {Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in galactic
 nuclei are thought to be a common by-product of major
 galaxy mergers. We use simple disk models for the
 circumbinary gas and for the binary-disk interaction to
 follow the orbital decay of SMBHBs with a range of total
 masses (M) and mass ratios (q), through physically distinct
 regions of the disk, until gravitational waves (GWs) take
 over their evolution. Prior to the GW-driven phase, the
 viscous decay is generically in the stalled
 "secondary-dominated" regime. SMBHBs spend a non-negligible
 fraction of a fiducial time of 107 yr at orbital periods
 between days lsimt orblsim yr, and we argue that they may
 be sufficiently common to be detectable, provided they are
 luminous during these stages. A dedicated optical or X-ray
 survey could identify coalescing SMBHBs statistically, as a
 population of periodically variable quasars, whose
 abundance obeys the scaling N var vprop t $\alpha$ var
 within a range of periods around t var\~{} tens of weeks.
 SMBHBs with M lsim 107 M sun, with 0.5 lsim $\alpha$ lsim
 1.5, would probe the physics of viscous orbital decay,
 whereas the detection of a population of higher-mass
 binaries, with $\alpha$ = 8/3, would confirm that their
 decay is driven by GWs. The lowest-mass SMBHBs (M lsim
 105-6 M sun) enter the GW-driven regime at short orbital
 periods, when they are already in the frequency band of the
 Laser Interferometric Space Antenna (LISA). While viscous
 processes are negligible in the last few years of
 coalescence, they could reduce the amplitude of any
 unresolved background due to near-stationary LISA sources.
 We discuss modest constraints on the SMBHB population
 already available from existing data, and the sensitivity
 and sky coverage requirements for a detection in future
 surveys. SMBHBs may also be identified from velocity shifts
 in their spectra; we discuss the expected abundance of
 SMBHBs as a function of their orbital velocity.},

  Abstract                 = {We have tested the two main theoretical models of bubbles
 around massive star clusters, Castor et al. and Chevalier &
 Clegg, against observations of the well-studied Carina
 nebula. The Castor et al. theory overpredicts the X-ray
 luminosity in the Carina bubble by a factor of 60 and
 expands too rapidly, by a factor of 4; if the correct
 radius and age are used, the predicted X-ray luminosity is
 even larger. In contrast, the Chevalier & Clegg model
 underpredicts the X-ray luminosity by a factor of 10. We
 modify the Castor et al. theory to take into account lower
 stellar wind mass-loss rates, radiation pressure, gravity,
 and escape of or energy loss from the hot shocked gas. We
 argue that energy is advected rather than radiated from the
 bubble. We undertake a parameter study for reduced stellar
 mass-loss rates and for various leakage rates and are able
 to find viable models. The X-ray surface brightness in
 Carina is highest close to the bubble wall, which is
 consistent with conductive evaporation from cold clouds.
 The picture that emerges is one in which the hot gas
 pressure is far below that found by dividing the
 time-integrated wind luminosity by the bubble volume;
 rather, the pressure in the hot gas is set by pressure
 equilibrium with the photoionized gas at T = 104 K. It
 follows that the shocked stellar winds are not dynamically
 important in forming the bubbles.},

 black holes. The accretion light curve is modulated over
 the binary orbital period owing to relativistic beaming.
 This periodic signal allows to detect the decay of the
 binary orbit due to gravitational wave emission by
 observing two tidal disruption events that are separated by
 more than a decade.},

 that is, a circular binary and an eccentric one, each with
 equal and unequal masses. We find that the circumblack-hole
 disks are formed around each black hole regardless of the
 simulation parameters. There are two-step mechanisms that
 cause accretion flow. First, tidally induced elongation of
 the circumbinary disk triggers mass inflow toward two
 closest points on the circumbinary disk. Then, the gas is
 increasingly accumulated on these two points owing to the
 gravitational attraction of black holes. Second, when the
 gas can pass across the maximum loci of the effective
 binary potential, it starts to overflow via their two
 points, and freely infalls to each black hole. In circular
 binaries, the gas continues to be supplied from the
 circumbinary disk, (i.e., the gap between the circumbinary
 disk and the binary black hole is always closed). In
 eccentric cases, the mass supply undergoes periodic on/off
 transitions during one orbital period because of the
 variation of the periodic potential. The gap starts to
 close after the apoastron, and to open again after the next
 periastron passage. Due to the gap closing/opening cycles,
 the mass-capture rates are eventually strongly phase
 dependent. This could provide observable diagnosis for the
 presence of supermassive binary black holes in merged
 galactic nuclei.},

 protoplanetary systems, and massive binary black hole
 systems in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, there is
 no definite evidence for the circumbinary disk except for
 some in a few young binary star systems. In this Letter, we
 study possible oscillation modes in circumbinary disks
 around eccentric and circular binaries. We find that
 prograde, nonaxisymmetric waves are induced in the inner
 part of the circumbinary disk by the tidal potential of the
 binary. Such waves would cause variabilities in emission
 line profiles from circumbinary disks. Because of prograde
 precession of the waves, the distance between each
 component of the binary and the inner edge of the
 circumbinary disk varies with the beat period between the
 precession period of the wave and the binary orbital
 period. As a result, light curves from the circumbinary
 disks are also expected to vary with the same period. The
 current study thus provides a new method to detect
 circumbinary disks in various astrophysical systems.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the circularization of tidally disrupted stars on bound orbits around spinning supermassive black holes by performing 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations with post-Newtonian corrections. Our simulations reveal that debris circularization depends sensitively on the efficiency of radiative cooling. There are two stages in debris circularization if radiative cooling is inefficient: first, the stellar debris streams self-intersect due to relativistic apsidal precession; shocks at the intersection points thermalize orbital energy and the debris forms a geometrically thick, ring-like structure around the black hole. The ring rapidly spreads via viscous diffusion, leading to the formation of a geometrically thick accretion disc. In contrast, if radiative cooling is efficient, the stellar debris circularizes due to self-intersection shocks and forms a geometrically thin ring-like structure. In this case, the dissipated energy can be emitted during debris circularization as a precursor to the subsequent tidal disruption flare. The circularization time-scale is remarkably long in the radiatively efficient cooling case, and is also sensitive to black hole spin. Specifically, Lense-Thirring torques cause dynamically important nodal precession, which significantly delays debris circularization. On the other hand, nodal precession is too slow to produce observable signatures in the radiatively inefficient case. Since the stellar debris is optically thick and its photon diffusion time is likely longer than the time-scale of shock heating, our inefficient cooling scenario is more generally applicable in eccentric tidal disruption events (TDEs). However, in parabolic TDEs for MBH ? 2 × 106 M?, the spin-sensitive behaviour associated with efficient cooling may be realized.},

 hydrodynamics simulations with a pseudo-Newtonian

 orbital eccentricity below which all the stellar debris
 remains bound to the black hole. For high but subcritical
 eccentricities, all the stellar mass is accreted on to the
 black hole in a finite time, causing a significant
 deviation from the canonical t-5/3 mass fallback rate. When
 a star is on a moderately eccentric orbit and its
 pericentre distance is deeply inside the tidal disruption
 radius, there can be several orbit crossings of the debris
 streams due to relativistic precession. This dissipates
 orbital energy in shocks, allowing for rapid
 circularization of the debris streams and formation of an
 accretion disc. The resultant accretion rate greatly
 exceeds the Eddington rate and differs strongly from the
 canonical rate of t-5/3. By contrast, there is little
 dissipation due to orbital crossings for the equivalent
 simulation with a purely Newtonian potential. This shows
 that general relativistic precession is crucial for
 accretion disc formation via circularization of stellar
 debris from stars on moderately eccentric orbits.},

Stars from the star cluster approaching the black hole can have three types of orbit: eccentric, parabolic, and hyperbolic. Since the mass fallback rate shows different variabilities depending on the orbital type, we can classify tidal disruption events (TDEs) into three main categories: eccentric, parabolic, and hyperbolic. The respective TDEs are characterized by two critical values of the orbital eccentricity: the lower critical eccentricity is the one below which stars on eccentric orbits cause finite, intense accretion, and the upper critical eccentricity is the one above which stars on hyperbolic orbits cause no accretion. Moreover, we find that parabolic TDEs can be divided into three subclasses: precisely parabolic, marginally eccentric, and marginally hyperbolic. We analytically derive that the mass fallback rate of marginally eccentric TDEs can be flatter and slightly higher than the standard fallback rate proportional to t ?5/3, whereas it can be flatter and lower for marginally hyperbolic TDEs. We confirm using N-body experiments that only a few eccentric, precisely parabolic, and hyperbolic TDEs can occur in a spherical stellar system with a single intermediate-mass to supermassive black hole. A substantial fraction of the stars approaching the black hole would cause marginally eccentric or marginally hyperbolic TDEs.},

 black holes (BHs) that produce radiant energy powered by
 accretion at rates in excess of Ëœ1% of the Eddington

 to produce the total mass budget in these BHs in Ëœ10 Gyr.
 The circumnuclear environment contains high-density cold
 gas and associated star formation. Major mergers are not
 the primary mechanism for transporting this gas inward;
 secular processes appear dominant. Stellar feedback is
 generic in these objects, and strong AGN feedback is seen
 only in the most powerful AGNs. In jet-mode AGNs the bulk
 of energetic output takes the form of collimated outflows
 (jets). These AGNs are associated with the more massive BHs
 in more massive (classical) bulges and elliptical galaxies.
 Neither the accretion onto these BHs nor star formation in
 their host bulge is significant today. These AGNs are
 probably fueled by the accretion of slowly cooling hot gas
 that is limited by the feedback/heating provided by AGN
 radio sources. Surveys of the high-redshift Universe paint
 a similar picture. Noting that the volume-averaged ratio of
 star formation to BH growth has remained broadly constant
 over the past 10 Gyrs, we argue that the processes that
 linked the cosmic evolution of galaxies and BHs are still
 at play today.},

  Abstract                 = {Very faint X-ray binaries (VFXBs), defined as having peak
 luminosities LX of 1034-1036 erg s-1, have been uncovered
 in significant numbers, but remain poorly understood. We
 analyse three published outburst light curves of two
 transient VFXBs using the exponential and linear decay
 formalism of King & Ritter. The decay time-scales and brink
 luminosities suggest orbital periods of order 1 h. We
 review various estimates of VFXB properties, and compare
 these with suggested explanations of the nature of VFXBs.
 We suggest that: (1) VFXB outbursts showing linear decays
 might be explained as partial drainings of the disc of
 `normal' X-ray transients, and many VFXB outbursts may
 belong to this category; (2) VFXB outbursts showing
 exponential decays are best explained by old, short-period
 systems involving mass transfer from a low-mass white dwarf
 or brown dwarf; (3) persistent (or quasi-persistent) VFXBs,
 which maintain an LX of 1034-1035 erg s-1 for years, may be
 explained by magnetospheric choking of the accretion flow
 in a propeller effect, permitting a small portion of the
 flow to accrete on to the neutron star's surface. We thus
 predict that (quasi-) persistent VFXBs may also be
 transitional millisecond pulsars, turning on as millisecond
 radio pulsars when their LX drops below 1032 erg s-1.},

  Abstract                 = {We identify through their X-ray spectra one certain (W37)
 and two probable (W17 and X4) quiescent low-mass X-ray
 binaries (qLMXBs) containing neutron stars in a long
 Chandra X-ray exposure of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae,
 in addition to the two previously known qLMXBs. W37's
 spectrum is dominated by a blackbody-like component
 consistent with radiation from the hydrogen atmosphere of a
 10 km neutron star. W37's light curve shows strong X-ray
 variability, which we attribute to variations in its
 absorbing column depth, and eclipses with a probable 3.087
 hr period. For most of our exposures, W37's blackbody-like
 emission (assumed to be from the neutron star surface) is
 almost completely obscured, yet some soft X-rays (of
 uncertain origin) remain. Two additional candidates, W17
 and X4, present X-ray spectra dominated by a harder
 component, fitted by a power law of photon index ~1.6-3. An
 additional soft component is required for both W17 and X4,
 which can be fitted with a 10 km hydrogen atmosphere
 neutron star model. X4 shows significant variability, which
 may arise from either its power-law or hydrogen atmosphere
 spectral component. Both W17 and X4 show rather low X-ray
 luminosities, LX(0.5-10keV)~5?031 ergs s-1. All three
 candidate qLMXBs would be difficult to identify in other
 globular clusters, suggesting an additional reservoir of
 fainter qLMXBs in globular clusters that may be of similar
 numbers as the group of previously identified objects. The
 number of millisecond pulsars inferred to exist in 47 Tuc
 is less than 10 times larger than the number of qLMXBs in
 47 Tuc, indicating that for typical inferred lifetimes of
 10 and 1 Gyr, respectively, their birthrates are
 comparable.},

  Abstract                 = {We have detected 300 X-ray sources within the half-mass
 radius (2.79 arcmin) of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae in
 a deep (281 ks) Chandra exposure. We perform photometry and
 simple spectral fitting for our detected sources and
 construct luminosity functions, X-ray color-magnitude, and
 color-color diagrams. Eighty-seven X-ray sources show
 variability on timescales from hours to years. Thirty-one
 of the new X-ray sources are identified with
 chromospherically active binaries from the catalogs of
 Albrow and coworkers. The radial distributions of detected
 sources imply that roughly 70 are background sources of
 some kind. The radial distribution of the known millisecond
 pulsar (MSP) systems is consistent with that expected from
 mass segregation, if the average neutron star mass is
 1.39+/-0.19 Msolar. Most source spectra are well fitted by
 thermal plasma models, except for quiescent low-mass X-ray
 binaries (qLMXBs; containing accreting neutron stars) and
 MSPs. We identify three new candidate qLMXBs with
 relatively low X-ray luminosities. One of the brightest
 cataclysmic variables (CVs; X10) shows evidence (a 4.7 hr
 period pulsation and strong soft X-ray emission) for a
 magnetically dominated accretion flow as in AM Her systems.
 Most of the bright CVs require intrinsic NH columns of
 order 1021 cm-2, suggesting a possible DQ Her nature. A
 group of X-ray sources associated with bright (sub)giant
 stars also requires intrinsic absorption. By comparing the
 X-ray colors, luminosities, variability, and quality of
 spectral fits of the detected MSPs to those of unidentified
 sources, we estimate that a total of ~25 MSPs exist in 47
 Tuc (<60 at 95% confidence), regardless of their radio
 beaming fraction. We estimate that the total number of
 neutron stars in 47 Tuc is of order 300, reducing the
 discrepancy between theoretical neutron star retention
 rates and observed neutron star populations in globular
 clusters. Comprehensive tables of source properties and
 simple spectral fits are provided electronically.},

  Abstract                 = {Quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries (qLMXBs) containing
 neutron stars have been identified in several globular
 clusters using Chandra or XMM X-ray observations, via their
 distinctive soft thermal spectra. We report a complete
 census of the qLMXB population in these clusters,
 identifying three additional probable qLMXBs in NGC 6440.
 We conduct several analyses of the qLMXB population and
 compare it with the harder, primarily cataclysmic variable
 (CV), population of low-luminosity X-ray sources with
 1031ergss-1<LX<1032.5 ergs s-1. The radial distribution of
 our qLMXB sample suggests an average system mass of
 1.5+0.3-0.2 Msolar, consistent with a neutron star and
 low-mass companion. Spectral analysis reveals that no
 globular cluster qLMXBs, other than the transient in NGC
 6440, require an additional hard power-law component, as
 often observed in field qLMXBs. We identify an empirical
 lower luminosity limit of ~1032 ergs s-1 among globular
 cluster qLMXBs. The bolometric luminosity range of qLMXBs
 implies (in the deep crustal heating model of Brown and
 collaborators) low time-averaged mass-transfer rates, below
 the disk stability criterion. The X-ray luminosity
 functions of the CV populations alone in NGC 6397 and 47
 Tuc are shown to differ. The distribution of qLMXBs among
 globular clusters is consistent with their dynamical
 formation by either tidal capture or exchange encounters,
 allowing us to estimate that 7 times more qLMXBs than
 bright LMXBs reside in globular clusters. The distribution
 of harder sources (primarily CVs) has a weaker dependence
 on density than that of the qLMXBs. Finally, we discuss
 possible effects of core collapse and globular cluster
 destruction on X-ray source populations.},

 Thirty-three of these have LX>1032 ergs s-1, the largest
 number yet seen in any globular cluster. In addition to the
 quiescent low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB; identified by
 Wijnands et al.), another 12 relatively soft sources may be
 quiescent LMXBs. We compare the X-ray colors of the harder
 sources in Terzan 5 to the Galactic center sources studied
 by Muno and collaborators and find the Galactic center
 sources to have harder X-ray colors, indicating a possible
 difference in the populations. We cannot clearly identify a
 metallicity dependence in the production of low-luminosity
 X-ray binaries in Galactic globular clusters, but a
 metallicity dependence of the form suggested by Jord? et
 al. for extragalactic LMXBs is consistent with our data.},

  Abstract                 = {We combine ionized gas ([N II] lambda6583) and stellar
 central velocity dispersions for a sample of 345 galaxies,
 with and without active galactic nuclei (AGNs), to study
 the dynamical state of the nuclear gas and its physical
 origin. The gas dispersions strongly correlate with the
 stellar dispersions over the velocity range of sigma â‰ˆ
 30-350 km s-1, such that sigma g /sigma* â‰ˆ 0.6-1.4, with
 an average value of 0.80. These results are independent of
 Hubble type (for galaxies from E to Sbc), the presence or
 absence of a bar, or local galaxy environment. For galaxies
 of type Sc and later and that have sigma* lsim 40 km s-1,
 the gas seems to have a minimum threshold of sigma g â‰ˆ 30
 km s-1, such that sigma g /sigma* always exceeds 1. Within
 the sample of AGNs, sigma g /sigma* increases with nuclear
 luminosity or Eddington ratio, a possible manifestation of
 AGN feedback associated with accretion disk winds or
 outflows. This extra source of nongravitational line
 broadening should be removed when trying to use sigma g to
 estimate sigma*. We show that the mass budget of the
 narrow-line region (NLR) can be accounted for by mass loss
 from evolved stars. The kinematics of the gas, dominated by
 random motions, largely reflect the velocity field of the
 hot gas in the bulge. Lastly, we offer a simple explanation
 for the correlation between line width and line luminosity
 observed in the NLR of AGNs.},

  Abstract                 = {We present and analyse a catalogue of 233 pulsars with
 proper motion measurements. The sample contains a wide
 variety of pulsars including recycled objects and those
 associated with globular clusters or supernova remnants.
 After taking the most precise proper motions for those
 pulsars for which multiple measurements are available, the
 majority of the proper motions (58 per cent) are derived
 from pulsar timing methods, 41 per cent using
 interferometers and the remaining 1 per cent using optical
 telescopes. Many of the one-dimensional (1D) and
 two-dimensional (2D) speeds (referring to speeds measured
 in one coordinate only and the magnitudes of the transverse
 velocities, respectively) derived from these measurements
 are somewhat lower than earlier estimates because of the
 use of the most recent electron density model in
 determining pulsar distances. The mean 1D speeds for the
 normal and recycled pulsars are 152(10) and 54(6)kms-1,
 respectively. The corresponding mean 2D speeds are 246(22)
 and 87(13)kms-1. PSRs B2011+38 and B2224+64 have the
 highest inferred 2D speeds of ~1600 km s-1. We study the
 mean speeds for different subsamples and find that, in
 general, they agree with previous results. Applying a novel
 deconvolution technique to the sample of 73 pulsars with
 characteristic ages less than 3Myr, we find the mean
 three-dimensional (3D) pulsar birth velocity to be
 400(40)kms-1. The distribution of velocities is well
 described by a Maxwellian distribution with 1D rms sigma=
 265 km s-1. There is no evidence for a bimodal velocity
 distribution. The proper motions for PSRs B1830-08 and
 B2334+61 are consistent with their proposed associations
 with the supernova remnants W41 and G114.3+0.3,
 respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {We present ground-based and Swift photometric and spectroscopic observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-15oi, discovered at the centre of 2MASX J20390918-3045201 (d ? 216 Mpc) by the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae. The source peaked at a bolometric luminosity of L ? 1.3 × 1044 erg s-1 and radiated a total energy of E ? 6.6 × 1050 erg over the first ?3.5 months of observations. The early optical/UV emission of the source can be fit by a blackbody with temperature increasing from T ? 2 × 104 K to T ? 4 × 104 K while the luminosity declines from L ? 1.3 × 1044 erg s-1 to L ? 2.3 × 1043 erg s-1, requiring the photosphere to be shrinking rapidly. The optical/UV luminosity decline during this period is most consistent with an exponential decline, L? e^{-(t-t_0)/?}, with ? ? 46.5 d for t0 ? 57241.6 (MJD), while a power-law decline of L ? (t - t0)-? with t0 ? 57 212.3 and ? = 1.62 provides a moderately worse fit. ASASSN-15oi also exhibits roughly constant soft X-ray emission that is significantly weaker than the optical/UV emission. Spectra of the source show broad helium emission lines and strong blue continuum emission in early epochs, although these features fade rapidly and are not present ?3 months after discovery. The early spectroscopic features and colour evolution of ASASSN-15oi are consistent with a TDE, but the rapid spectral evolution is unique among optically selected TDEs.},

  Abstract                 = {We present ground-based and Swift photometric and
 spectroscopic observations of the candidate tidal
 disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14li, found at the centre of
 PGC 043234 (d ~= 90 Mpc) by the All-Sky Automated Survey
 for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). The source had a peak bolometric
 luminosity of L ~= 1044 erg s-1 and a total integrated
 energy of E ~= 7 Ã— 1050 erg radiated over the Ëœ6 months
 of observations presented. The UV/optical emission of the
 source is well fitted by a blackbody with roughly constant
 temperature of T Ëœ 35 000 K, while the luminosity declines
 by roughly a factor of 16 over this time. The optical/UV
 luminosity decline is broadly consistent with an
 exponential decline, Lâˆ e^{-t/t_0}, with t0 ~= 60 d.
 ASASSN-14li also exhibits soft X-ray emission comparable in
 luminosity to the optical and UV emission but declining at
 a slower rate, and the X-ray emission now dominates.
 Spectra of the source show broad Balmer and helium lines in
 emission as well as strong blue continuum emission at all
 epochs. We use the discoveries of ASASSN-14li and
 ASASSN-14ae to estimate the TDE rate implied by ASAS-SN,
 finding an average rate of r ~= 4.1 Ã— 10-5 yr-1 per galaxy
 with a 90 per cent confidence interval of (2.2-17.0) Ã—
 10-5 yr-1 per galaxy. ASAS-SN found roughly 1 TDE for every
 70 Type Ia supernovae in 2014, a rate that is much higher
 than that of other surveys.},

  Abstract                 = {Context: The stellar mass loss rate is important for the
 rotational evolution of a star and for its interaction with
 the circumstellar environment. The analysis of astrospheric
 absorption features enables an empirical determination of
 mass loss rates of cool stars other than the Sun. Aims: We
 develop a model for the wind properties of cool
 main-sequence stars, which comprises their wind ram
 pressures, mass fluxes, and terminal wind velocities.
 Methods: The wind properties are determined through a
 polytropic magnetised wind model, assuming power laws for
 the dependence of the thermal and magnetic wind parameters
 on the stellar rotation rate. We use the empirical data to
 constrain theoretical wind scenarios, which are
 characterised by different rates of increase of the wind
 temperature, wind density, and magnetic field strength.
 Results: Scenarios based on moderate rates of increase
 yield wind ram pressures in agreement with most empirical
 constraints, but cannot account for some moderately
 rotating targets, whose high apparent mass loss rates are
 inconsistent with observed coronal X-ray and magnetic
 properties. For fast magnetic rotators, the
 magneto-centrifugal driving of the outflow can produce
 terminal wind velocities far in excess of the surface
 escape velocity. Disregarding this aspect in the analyses
 of wind ram pressures leads to overestimations of stellar
 mass loss rates. The predicted mass loss rates of cool
 main-sequence stars do not exceed about ten times the solar
 value. Conclusions: .Our results are in contrast with
 previous investigations, which found a strong increase of
 the stellar mass loss rates with the coronal X-ray flux.
 Owing to the weaker dependence, we expect the impact of
 stellar winds on planetary atmospheres to be less severe
 and the detectability of magnetospheric radio emission to
 be lower then previously suggested. Considering the
 rotational evolution of a 1 {M&sun;} star, the mass loss
 rates and the wind ram pressures are highest during the
 pre-main sequence phase.},

  Abstract                 = {We use multiscale smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to study the inflow of gas from galactic scales (~10kpc) down to <~ 0.1pc, at which point the gas begins to resemble a traditional, Keplerian accretion disc. The key ingredients of the simulations are gas, stars, black holes (BHs), self-gravity, star formation and stellar feedback (via a subgrid model); BH feedback is not included. We use ~100 simulations to survey a large parameter space of galaxy properties and subgrid models for the interstellar medium physics. We generate initial conditions for our simulations of galactic nuclei (<~ 300pc) using galaxy-scale simulations, including both major galaxy mergers and isolated bar-(un)stable disc galaxies. For sufficiently gas-rich, disc-dominated systems, we find that a series of gravitational instabilities generates large accretion rates of up to ~ 1-10 Msolar yr-1 on to the BH (i.e. at <~ 0.1pc) this is comparable to what is needed to fuel the most luminous quasars. The BH accretion rate is highly time variable for a given set of conditions in the galaxy at ~kpc. At radii of >rsim 10 pc, our simulations resemble the `bars-within-bars' model of Shlosman et al., but we show that the gas can have a diverse array of morphologies, including spirals, rings, clumps and bars; the duty cycle of these features is modest, complicating attempts to correlate BH accretion with the morphology of gas in galactic nuclei. At ~ 1-10 pc, the gravitational potential becomes dominated by the BH and bar-like modes are no longer present. However, we show that the gas can become unstable to a standing, eccentric disc or a single-armed spiral mode (m = 1), in which the stars and gas precess at different rates, driving the gas to sub-pc scales (again for sufficiently gas-rich, disc-dominated systems). A proper treatment of this mode requires including star formation and the self-gravity of both the stars and gas (which has not been the case in many previous calculations). Our simulations predict a correlation between the BH accretion rate and the star formation rate at different galactic radii. We find that nuclear star formation is more tightly coupled to active galactic nucleus activity than the global star formation rate of a galaxy, but a reasonable correlation remains even for the latter.},

  Abstract                 = {Resonant relaxation (RR) of orbital angular momenta occurs
 near massive black holes (MBHs) where the potential is
 spherical and stellar orbits are nearly Keplerian and so do
 not precess significantly. The resulting coherent torques
 efficiently change the magnitude of the angular momenta and
 rotate the orbital inclination in all directions. As a
 result, many of the tightly bound stars very near the MBH
 are rapidly destroyed by falling into the MBH on low
 angular momentum orbits, while the orbits of the remaining
 stars are efficiently randomized. We solve numerically the
 Fokker-Planck equation in energy for the steady state
 distribution of a single-mass population with an RR sink
 term. We find that the steady state current of stars, which
 sustains the accelerated drainage close to the MBH, can be
 <~10 larger than that due to noncoherent two-body
 relaxation alone. RR mostly affects tightly bound stars,
 and so it increases only moderately the total tidal
 disruption rate, which is dominated by stars originating
 from less bound orbits farther away. We show that the event
 rate of gravitational wave (GW) emission from inspiraling
 stars, originating much closer to the MBH, is dominated by
 RR dynamics. The GW event rate depends on the uncertain
 efficiency of RR. The efficiency indicated by the few
 available simulations implies rates <~10 times higher than
 those predicted by two-body relaxation, which would improve
 the prospects of detecting such events by future GW
 detectors, such as LISA. However, a higher, but still
 plausible, RR efficiency can lead to the drainage of all
 tightly bound stars and strong suppression of GW events
 from inspiraling stars. We apply our results to the
 Galactic MBH and show that the observed dynamical
 properties of stars there are consistent with RR.},

 remnant stages. For the most part we find continuous
 formulae accurate to within 5 per cent of detailed models.
 These formulae are useful for purposes such as population
 synthesis that require very rapid but accurate evaluation
 of stellar properties, and in particular for use in
 combination with N-body codes. We describe a mass-loss

 investigate the resulting stellar remnant distribution.},

 non-self-gravitating circumbinary accretion disc is
 considered. The shape of the stationary twisted disc
 produced by the binary is calculated. It is shown that the
 inner part of the disc must lie in the binary orbital plane
 for any value of the viscosity. When the inner disc
 mid-plane is aligned with the binary orbital plane on the
 scales of interest and it rotates in the same sense as the
 binary, the modification to the disc structure and the rate
 of decay of the binary orbit, assumed circular, caused by
 tidal exchange of angular momentum with the disc, are
 calculated. It is shown that the modified disc structure is
 well described by a self-similar solution of the non-linear
 diffusion equation governing the evolution of the disc
 surface density. The calculated time-scale for decay of the
 binary orbit is always smaller than the `accretion'
 time-scale t\_acc=m/Msolar (m is the mass of the secondary
 component, and Msolar is the disc accretion rate), and is
 determined by the ratio of the secondary mass m, assumed to
 be much smaller than the primary mass, the disc mass inside
 the initial binary orbit, and the form of viscosity in the
 disc.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the evolution of binary stars in globular
 clusters using a new Monte Carlo approach combining a
 population synthesis code (STARTRACK) and a simple
 treatment of dynamical interactions in the dense cluster
 core using a new tool for computing three- and four-body
 interactions (FEWBODY). We find that the combination of
 stellar evolution and dynamical interactions (binary-single
 and binary-binary) leads to a rapid depletion of the binary
 population in the cluster core. The maximum binary fraction
 today in the core of a typical dense cluster such as 47
 Tuc, assuming an initial binary fraction of 100 per cent,
 is only ~5-10 per cent. We show that this is in good
 agreement with recent Hubble Space Telescope observations
 of close binaries in the core of 47 Tuc, provided that a
 realistic distribution of binary periods is used to
 interpret the results. Our findings also have important
 consequences for the dynamical modelling of globular
 clusters, suggesting that `realistic models' should
 incorporate much larger initial binary fractions than has
 usually been the case in the past.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, the second of a series, we study the
 stellar dynamical and evolutionary processes leading to the
 formation of compact binaries containing neutron stars
 (NSs) in dense globular clusters. For this study, 70 dense
 clusters were simulated independently, with a total stellar
 mass ~2 Ã— 107Msolar, exceeding the total mass of all dense
 globular clusters in our Galaxy. We find that, in order to
 reproduce the empirically derived formation rate of
 low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), we must assume that NSs
 can be formed via electron-capture supernovae with typical
 natal kicks smaller than in core-collapse supernovae. Our
 results explain the observed dependence of the number of
 LMXBs on `collision number' as well as the large scatter
 observed between different globular clusters. We predict
 that the number of quiescent LMXBs in different clusters
 should not have a strong metallicity dependence. We compare
 the results obtained from our simulations with the observed
 population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We find that in
 our cluster model the following mass-gaining events create
 populations of MSPs that do not match the observations
 (either they are inconsistent with the observed LMXB
 production rates, or the inferred binary periods or
 companion masses are not observed among radio bMSPs): (i)
 accretion during a common-envelope event with a NS formed
 through electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe), and (ii) mass
 transfer (MT) from a white dwarf donor. Some processes lead
 only to a mild recycling - physical collisions or MT in a
 post-accretion-induced collapse system. In addition, for
 MSPs, we distinguish low magnetic field (long-lived) and
 high magnetic field (short-lived) populations, where in the
 latter NSs are formed as a result of accretion-induced
 collapse or merger-induced collapse. With this distinction
 and by considering only those mass-gaining events that
 appear to lead to NS recycling, we obtain good agreement of
 our models with the numbers and characteristics of observed
 MSPs in 47 Tuc and Terzan 5, as well as with the cumulative
 statistics for MSPs detected in globular clusters of
 different dynamical properties. We find that significant
 production of merging double NSs potentially detectable as
 short gamma-ray bursts occurs only in very dense, most
 likely core-collapsed clusters.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose that the shape of the upper-end X-ray
 luminosity function (XLF) observed in elliptical galaxies
 for point sources carries valuable information about the
 black hole (BH) mass spectrum among old X-ray transients
 formed in the galaxies. Here we present the line of
 arguments and analysis that support this connection and the
 methodology for deriving the BH mass spectrum slope from
 the observed XLF slope. We show that this underlying BH
 mass spectrum is modified by a weighting factor that is
 related to the transient duty cycle, and it generally
 depends on the host galaxy age, the BH mass, and the X-ray
 binary (XRB) donor type (main-sequence, red giant, or white
 dwarf donors). We find that the observed XLF is dominated
 by transient BH systems in outburst (a prediction possibly
 testable by future observations) but that the assumption of
 a constant duty cycle for all systems leads to results
 inconsistent with current observations. We also find that
 the derived BH mass slope depends on the strength of the
 angular momentum loss due to magnetic braking for
 main-sequence donors. More specifically, we find that for
 ``standard'' magnetic braking, BH XRBs with red giant
 donors dominate the upper-end XLF but that for weaker
 magnetic braking prescriptions, main-sequence donors are
 found to be dominant. The methodology presented here can be
 used in the future as our understanding of the transient
 duty and its dependence on binary and mass transfer
 properties improves. Under certain assumptions for this
 dependence, we derive a differential BH mass spectrum slope
 of ~=2.5 an upper BH mass cutoff at ~=20 Msolar is needed
 to understand the very brightest of the BH XRBs in
 elliptical galaxies. We also show that our quantitative
 results are robust against expected variations by factors
 of a few of the outburst peak X-ray luminosities. We expect
 that our analysis will eventually help to constrain binary
 population synthesis models and the adopted relations
 between black holes and the masses of their progenitors.},

  Abstract                 = {Many topics in planetary studies demand an estimate of the collision probability of two objects moving on nearly Keplerian orbits. In the classic works of {\"{O}}pik and Wetherill, the collision probability was derived by linearizing the motion near the collision points, and there is now a vast amount of literature using their method. We present here a simpler and more physically motivated derivation for non-tangential collisions in Keplerian orbits, as well as for tangential collisions that were not previously considered. Our formulas have the added advantage of being manifestly symmetric in the parameters of the two colliding bodies. In common with the {\"{O}}pik-Wetherill treatments, we linearize the motion of the bodies in the vicinity of the point of orbit intersection (or near the points of minimum distance between the two orbits) and assume a uniform distribution of impact parameter within the collision radius. We point out that the linear approximation leads to singular results for the case of tangential encounters. We regularize this singularity by use of a parabolic approximation of the motion in the vicinity of a tangential encounter.},

  Abstract                 = {We study super-Eddington accretion flows onto black holes
 using a global three-dimensional radiation
 magneto-hydrodynamical simulation. We solve the
 time-dependent radiative transfer equation for the specific
 intensities to accurately calculate the angular
 distribution of the emitted radiation. Turbulence generated
 by the magneto-rotational instability provides
 self-consistent angular momentum transfer. The simulation
 reaches inflow equilibrium with an accretion rate ~220 L
 Edd/c 2 and forms a radiation-driven outflow along the
 rotation axis. The mechanical energy flux carried by the
 outflow is ~20% of the radiative energy flux. The total
 mass flux lost in the outflow is about 29% of the net
 accretion rate. The radiative luminosity of this flow is
 ~10 L Edd. This yields a radiative efficiency ~4.5%, which
 is comparable to the value in a standard thin disk model.
 In our simulation, vertical advection of radiation caused
 by magnetic buoyancy transports energy faster than photon
 diffusion, allowing a significant fraction of the photons
 to escape from the surface of the disk before being
 advected into the black hole. We contrast our results with
 the lower radiative efficiencies inferred in most models,
 such as the slim disk model, which neglect vertical
 advection. Our inferred radiative efficiencies also exceed
 published results from previous global numerical
 simulations, which did not attribute a significant role to
 vertical advection. We briefly discuss the implications for
 the growth of supermassive black holes in the early
 universe and describe how these results provided a basis
 for explaining the spectrum and population statistics of
 ultraluminous X-ray sources.},

Electron heat conduction is important for low accretion rate systems where the electron cooling time is longer than the conduction time of the plasma, such as Sgr A* in the Galactic center.

Electron conduction may thus be an important ingredient in explaining the low radiative efficiencies and low accretion rates inferred from observations of low-luminosity galactic nuclei.

  Abstract                 = {We analyse the observed distribution of Eddington ratios
 (L/LEdd) as a function of supermassive black hole mass for
 a large sample of nearby galaxies drawn from the Sloan
 Digital Sky Survey. We demonstrate that there are two
 distinct regimes of black hole growth in nearby galaxies.
 The first is associated with galaxies with significant star
 formation [M*/starformationrate (SFR) ~ a Hubble time] in
 their central kiloparsec regions, and is characterized by a
 broad lognormal distribution of accretion rates peaked at a
 few per cent of the Eddington limit. In this regime, the
 Eddington ratio distribution is independent of the mass of
 the black hole and shows little dependence on the central
 stellar population of the galaxy. The second regime is
 associated with galaxies with old central stellar
 populations (M*/SFR >> a Hubble time), and is characterized
 by a power-law distribution function of Eddington ratios.
 In this regime, the time-averaged mass accretion rate on to
 black holes is proportional to the mass of stars in the
 galaxy bulge, with a constant of proportionality that
 depends on the mean stellar age of the stars. This result
 is once again independent of black hole mass. We show that
 both the slope of the power law and the decrease in the
 accretion rate on to black holes in old galaxies are
 consistent with population synthesis model predictions of
 the decline in stellar mass loss rates as a function of
 mean stellar age. Our results lead to a very simple picture
 of black hole growth in the local Universe. If the supply
 of cold gas in a galaxy bulge is plentiful, the black hole
 regulates its own growth at a rate that does not further
 depend on the properties of the interstellar medium. Once
 the gas runs out, black hole growth is regulated by the
 rate at which evolved stars lose their mass.},

  Abstract                 = {The transient Swift J1644+57 is believed to have been
 produced by an unlucky star wandering too close to a
 supermassive black hole (BH) leading to a tidal disruption
 event. This unusual flare displayed highly super-Eddington
 X-ray emission which likely originated in a relativistic,
 collimated jet. This presents challenges to modern
 accretion and jet theory as upper limits of prior BH
 activity, which we obtain from the radio afterglow of this
 event, imply that both the pre-disruption BH and stellar
 magnetic fluxes fall many orders of magnitude short of what
 is required to power the observed X-ray luminosity. We
 argue that a pre-existing, `fossil' accretion disc can
 contain a sufficient reservoir of magnetic flux and that
 the stellar debris stream is capable of dragging this flux
 into the BH. To demonstrate this, we perform local, 3D
 magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the disc-stream
 interaction and demonstrate that the interface between the
 two is unstable to mixing. This mixing entrains a
 sufficient amount of fossil disc magnetic flux into the
 infalling stellar debris to power the jet. We argue that
 the interaction with the fossil disc can have a pronounced
 effect on the structure and dynamics of mass fallback and
 likely the resulting transient. Finally, we describe
 possible ramifications of these interactions on unresolved
 problems in tidal disruption dynamics, in particular, the
 efficiency of debris circularization, and effects of the
 disruption on the pre-existing BH system.},

  Abstract                 = {In spherical galaxies, binary supermassive black holes
 (SMBHs) have difficulty reaching sub-parsec separations due
 to depletion of stars on orbits that intersect the massive
 binary---the "final parsec problem." Galaxies that form via
 major mergers are substantially non-spherical, and it has
 been argued that the centrophilic orbits in triaxial
 galaxies might provide stars to the massive binary at a
 high enough rate to avoid stalling. Here we test that idea
 by carrying out fully self-consistent merger simulations of
 galaxies containing central SMBHs. We find hardening rates
 of the massive binaries that are indeed much higher than in
 spherical models and essentially independent of the number
 of particles used in the simulations. Binary eccentricities
 remain high throughout the simulations. Our results
 constitute a fully stellar-dynamical solution to the final
 parsec problem and imply a potentially high rate of events
 for low-frequency gravitational wave detectors like LISA.},

 (RG) stars within the central 0.5 pc in the Galactic Center

 hypothesis that collisions of stars with a fragmenting
 accretion disk are responsible for the observed dearth of
 evolved stars. We use three-dimensional hydrodynamic
 simulations to model a star with radius 10 R &sun; and mass
 1 M &sun;, representative of the missing population of RGs,
 colliding with high density clumps. We find that multiple
 collisions with clumps of column density â‰³108 g cm-2 can
 strip a substantial fraction of the star's envelope and in
 principle render it invisible to observations. Simulations
 confirm that repeated impacts are particularly efficient in
 driving mass loss as partially stripped RGs expand and have
 increased cross sections for subsequent collisions. Because
 the envelope is unbound on account of the kinetic energy of
 the star, any significant amount of stripping of the RG
 population in the GC should be mirrored by a systematic
 decay of their orbits and possibly by their enhanced
 rotational velocity. To be viable, this scenario requires
 that the total mass of the fragmenting disk has been
 several orders of magnitude higher than that of the
 early-type stars which now form the stellar disk in the
 GC.},

 investigate the incidence of low-mass X-ray binaries
 (LMXBs) and their birth rate in the Galaxy. We use a
 binary-evolution algorithm that models all the relevant
 processes including tidal circularization and
 synchronization. Parameters in the evolution algorithm that
 are uncertain and may affect X-ray binary formation are
 allowed to vary during the investigation. We agree with
 previous studies that under standard assumptions of binary
 evolution the formation rate and number of black hole (BH)
 LMXBs predicted by the model are more than an order of
 magnitude less than what is indicated by observations. We
 find that the common-envelope process cannot be manipulated
 to produce significant numbers of BH LMXBs. However, by
 simply reducing the mass-loss rate from helium stars
 adopted in the standard model, to a rate that agrees with
 the latest data, we produce a good match to the
 observations. Including LMXBs that evolve from
 intermediate-mass systems also leads to favourable results.
 We stress that constraints on the X-ray binary population
 provided by observations are used here merely as a guide as
 surveys suffer from incompleteness and much uncertainty is
 involved in the interpretation of results.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent X-ray observations of intense high-speed outflows
 in quasars suggest that supercritical accretion on to the
 central black hole may have an important effect on a host
 galaxy. I revisit some ideas of Silk & Rees and assume that
 such flows occur in the final stages of building up the
 black hole mass. It is now possible to model explicitly the
 interaction between the outflow and the host galaxy. This
 is found to resemble a momentum-driven stellar wind bubble,
 implying a relation MBH=(fg?/2?G2)?4~=1.5?08?4200 Msolar
 between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion
 (fg=gas fraction of total matter density, ?=electron
 scattering opacity), without free parameters. This is
 remarkably close to the observed relation in both slope and
 normalization. This result suggests that the central black
 holes in galaxies gain most of their mass in phases of
 super-Eddington accretion, which are presumably obscured or
 at high redshift. Observed super-Eddington quasars are
 apparently late in growing their black hole masses.},

  Abstract                 = {Stars in the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be ripped apart by the tidal forces of the black hole. The subsequent accretion of the stellar material causes a spectacular flare of electromagnetic radiation. Here, we provide a review of the observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs), with an emphasis on the important contributions of Swift to this field. TDEs represent a new probe of matter under strong gravity, and have opened up a new window into studying accretion physics under extreme conditions. The events probe relativistic effects, provide a new means of measuring black hole spin, and represent signposts of intermediate-mass BHs, binary BHs and recoiling BHs. Luminous, high-amplitude X-ray flares, matching key predictions of the tidal disruption scenario, have first been discovered with ROSAT, and more recently with other missions and in other wavebands. The Swift discovery of two ?-ray emitting, jetted TDEs, never seen before, has provided us with a unique probe of the early phases of jet formation and evolution, and Swift J1644+75 has the best covered lightcurve of any TDE to date. Further, Swift has made important contributions in providing well-covered lightcurves of TDEs discovered with other instruments, setting constraints on the physics that govern the TDE evolution, and including the discovery of the first candidate binary SMBH identified from a TDE lightcurve. In X-rays, TDEs probe relativistic effects (via emission-line profiles or precession effects in the Kerr metric) and the extremes of accretion physics at high rates and near the last stable orbit, and provide us with a new means of measuring BH spin. Jetted TDEs provide new insight into the formation and early evolution of radio jets, and may shed new light on related issues like the cause of the radio-loud radio-quiet dichotomy of active galactic nuclei (AGN). TDEs, once detected in large numbers, will unveil the population of IMBHs in the universe. TDE rates depend on, and therefore trace, stellar dynamics in galaxy cores on spatial scales which cannot be resolved directly. TDEs are signposts of binary SMBHs and recoiling BHs, because their rates are strongly enhanced under these conditions, and TDEs will occur off-nuclear if the SMBH is recoiling. TDEs in gas-rich environments will illuminate the circum-nuclear material, so that the reprocessed emission lines and their temporal evolution provide us with an unparalleled opportunity of reverberation mapping the cores of quiescent galaxies. Here, we present an overview of the status of observations of TDEs, highlighting the important role plaid by the Swift mission (Gehrels et al., 2004; Gehrels and Cannizzo, in press). An accompanying review by Lodato (in press) will focus on theoretical aspects of tidal disruption.},

 supermassive binary black holes in galaxies and for the

 hierarchical galaxy merger models, binary black holes
 should form frequently, and should be common in the cores
 of galaxies. The presence of massive black hole binaries
 has been invoked to explain a number of class properties of
 different types of galaxies, and in triggering various
 forms of activity. Coalescing massive black hole binaries
 are powerful emitters of gravitational waves. The search
 for such binary black holes is therefore of great interest
 for several topics in astrophysics ranging from galaxy
 formation to activity in galaxies.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent work Baldwin et al. proposed that in the
 geometrically extended broad-line regions (BLRs) of quasars
 and active galactic nuclei, a range in line-emitting gas
 properties (e.g., density, column density) might exist at
 each radius and showed that under these conditions the
 broad emission line spectra of these objects may be
 dominated by selection effects introduced by the atomic
 physics and general radiative transfer within the large
 pool of line-emitting entities. In this picture, the light
 we see originates in a vast amalgam of emitters but is
 dominated by those emitters best able to reprocess the
 incident continuum into a particular emission line. We test
 this ``locally optimally emitting clouds'' (LOC) model
 against the extensive spectroscopic database of the Seyfert
 1 galaxy NGC 5548. The time-averaged, integrated-light UV
 broad emission line spectrum from the 1993 Hubble Space
 Telescope (HST) monitoring campaign is reproduced via the
 optimization of three global geometric parameters: the
 outer radius, the index controlling the radial cloud
 covering fraction of the continuum source, and the
 integrated cloud covering fraction. We make an ad hoc
 selection from the range of successful models, and for a
 simple spherical BLR geometry we simulate the emission-line
 light curves for the 1989 IUE and 1993 HST campaigns, using
 the respective observed UV continuum light curves as
 drivers. We find good agreement between the predicted and
 observed light curves and lags-a demonstration of the LOC
 picture's viability as a means to understanding the BLR
 environment. Finally, we discuss the next step in
 developing the LOC picture, which involves the marriage of
 echo-mapping techniques with spectral simulation grids such
 as those presented here, using the constraints provided by
 a high-quality, temporally well-sampled spectroscopic data
 set.},

  Abstract                 = {The high spatial resolution and precise astrometry and photometry of the Gaia mission should make it particularly apt at discovering and resolving transients occurring in, or near, the centres of galaxies. Indeed, some nuclear transients are reported by the Gaia Science Alerts (GSA) team, but not a single confirmed Tidal Disruption Event has been published. In order to explore the sensitivity of GSA, we performed an independent and systematic search for nuclear transients using Gaia observations. Our transient search is driven from an input galaxy catalogue (derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Release 12). We present a candidate detection metric which is independent from the existing GSA methodology, to see if Gaia Alerts are biased against the discovery of nuclear transients, and in particular which steps may have an impact. Our technique does require significant manual vetting of candidates, making implementation in the GSA system impractical for daily operations, although it could be run weekly, which for month-to-year long transients would make a scientifically valuable addition. Our search yielded ?480 nuclear transients, 5 of which were alerted and published by GSA. The list of (in some cases ongoing) transients includes candidates for events related to enhanced accretion onto a super-massive black hole and TDEs. An implementation of the detection methodology and criteria used in this paper as an extension of GSA could open up the possibility for Gaia to fulfil the role as a main tool to find transient nuclear activity as predicted in the literature.},

  Abstract                 = {We report the first results of an extensive new study of
 the Galactic center stellar cluster. The central parsec is
 powered by a cluster of about two dozen luminous and
 helium-rich blue supergiants/Wolf-Rayet stars (Teff ~
 20,000--30,000 K) with ZAMS masses up to ~100 M&sun;. The
 most likely scenario for the formation of the massive stars
 is a small star formation burst between 3 x 106 and 7 x 106
 years ago. In this scenario the Galactic center is
 presently in a short-lived, post--main-sequence "wind
 phase." In addition, there is evidence for another star
 formation event about 108 years ago, as well as for
 recently formed massive stars that may have been
 transported into the central core along with orbiting gas
 streamers. The radial velocity dispersion of 35 early- and
 late-type stars with distances of 1"--12" from Sgr A* is
 154 +/- 19 km s-1. Our new results strongly favor the
 existence of a central dark mass of ~3 x 106 M&sun;

  Abstract                 = {We investigate nuclear light profiles in 135 ATLAS3D
 galaxies for which the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging
 is available and compare them to the large-scale kinematics
 obtained with the SAURON integral-field spectrograph.
 Specific angular momentum, lambdaR, correlates with the
 shape of nuclear light profiles, where, as suggested by
 previous studies, cores are typically found in slow
 rotators and core-less galaxies are fast rotators. As also
 shown before, cores are found only in massive galaxies and
 only in systems with the stellar mass (measured via
 dynamical models) M â‰³ 8 Ã— 1010 M&sun;. Based on our
 sample, we, however, see no evidence for a bimodal
 distribution of nuclear slopes. The best predictor for
 finding a core is based on the stellar velocity dispersion
 within an effective radius, sigmae, and specific angular
 momentum, where cores are found for lambdaR â‰² 0.25 and
 sigmae â‰³ 160 km s-1. We estimate that only about 10 per
 cent of nearby early-type galaxies contain cores.
 Furthermore, we show that there is a genuine population of
 fast rotators with cores. We also show that core fast
 rotators are morphologically, kinematically and dynamically
 different from core slow rotators. The cores of fast
 rotators, however, could harbour black holes of similar
 masses to those in core slow rotators, but typically more
 massive than those found in core-less fast rotators. Cores
 of both fast and slow rotators are made of old stars and
 found in galaxies typically lacking molecular or atomic gas
 (with a few exceptions). Core-less galaxies, and especially
 core-less fast rotators, are underluminous in the diffuse
 X-ray emission, but the presence of a core does not imply
 high X-ray luminosities. Additionally, we postulate (as
 many of these galaxies lack HST imaging) a possible
 population of core-less galaxies among slow rotators, which
 cannot be explained as face-on discs, but comprise a
 genuine sub-population of slow rotators. These galaxies are
 typically less massive and flatter than core slow rotators,
 and show evidence for dynamical cold structures and
 exponential photometric components. Based on our findings,
 major non-dissipative (gas-poor) mergers together with
 black hole binary evolution may not be the only path for
 formation of cores in early-type galaxies. We discuss
 possible processes for formation of cores and their
 subsequent preservation.},

We show that it is possible to form mass-transferring BH binaries with main sequence, giant, and white dwarf companions with a variety of orbital parameters in GCs spanning a large range in present-day properties. All mass-transferring BH binaries found in our models at late times are dynamically created. The BHs in these systems experienced a median of ?30 dynamical encounters within the cluster before and after acquiring the donor. Furthermore, we show that the presence of mass-transferring BH systems has little correlation with the total number of BHs within the cluster at any time. This is because the net rate of formation of BH?non-BH binaries in a cluster is largely independent of the total number of retained BHs. Our results suggest that the detection of a mass-transferring BH binary in a GC does not necessarily indicate that the host cluster contains a large BH population.},

  Abstract                 = {ASASSN-14li is a recently discovered tidal disruption event with an exceptionally rich data set: spectra and lightcurves in soft X-rays, UV, optical, and radio. To understand its emission properties in all these bands, we have extended our model for post-tidal disruption accretion and photon production to estimate both soft X-ray radiation produced by the ?prompt? accretion phase and synchrotron emission associated with the bow shock driven through an external medium by the unbound tidal debris, as well as optical and UV light. We find that fiducial values of the stellar mass (1{M}? ) and black hole mass ({10}6.5{M}? ) yield quantitative agreement with the optical/UV luminosity, lightcurve, and color temperature; approximate agreement with the soft X-ray spectrum and lightcurve; and quantitative agreement with the radio luminosity, spectrum, and lightcurve. Equipartition analysis of the radio data implies that the radio-emitting region expands with a constant speed, and its magnitude is comparable to the speed expected for the unbound stellar ejecta. Both facts provide strong support to our model. We find that the disruption event took place in 2014 mid-September. Two independent parameters, the magnitude and logarithmic radial gradient of the ambient gas density near the black hole, must be fit to the data to explain the radio emission; their inferred values are comparable to those found near both Sgr A* and the TDE candidate Swift J1644.},

  Abstract                 = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive,
 but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF
 exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF
 with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for
 star formation. In this contribution an average or
 Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is
 evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two
 masses: near 0.5Msolar and near 0.08Msolar. Using this
 supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any
 observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by
 studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the
 dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this
 apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter
 in power-law index determinations, thus defining the
 fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes
 undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF
 means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied
 populations must be smaller than this scatter.
 Determinations of the power-law indices alpha are subject
 to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved
 binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the
 result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters
 are systematically steeper by Deltaalpha~0.5 between 0.1
 and 1Msolar than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated
 by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular
 clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter
 than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto & Zoccali; Paresce & De
 Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf
 candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of
 associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M{\'e}ndez &
 Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient
 population. Star formation in higher metallicity
 environments thus appears to produce relatively more
 low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an
 interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic
 variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical
 arguments.},

  Abstract                 = {The star formation rate (SFR) in the Central Molecular
 Zone (CMZ, i.e. the central 500 pc) of the Milky Way is
 lower by a factor of >=10 than expected for the substantial
 amount of dense gas it contains, which challenges current
 star formation theories. In this paper, we quantify which
 physical mechanisms could be responsible. On scales larger
 than the disc scaleheight, the low SFR is found to be
 consistent with episodic star formation due to secular
 instabilities or possibly variations of the gas inflow
 along the Galactic bar. The CMZ is marginally Toomre-stable
 when including gas and stars, but highly Toomre-stable when
 only accounting for the gas, indicating a low condensation
 rate of self-gravitating clouds. On small scales, we find
 that the SFR in the CMZ may be caused by an elevated
 critical density for star formation due to the high
 turbulent pressure. The existence of a universal density
 threshold for star formation is ruled out. The H I-H2 phase
 transition of hydrogen, the tidal field, a possible
 underproduction of massive stars due to a bottom-heavy
 initial mass function, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray or
 radiation pressure feedback also cannot individually
 explain the low SFR. We propose a self-consistent cycle of
 star formation in the CMZ, in which the effects of several
 different processes combine to inhibit star formation. The
 rate-limiting factor is the slow evolution of the gas
 towards collapse - once star formation is initiated it
 proceeds at a normal rate. The ubiquity of star formation
 inhibitors suggests that a lowered central SFR should be a
 common phenomenon in other galaxies. We discuss the
 implications for galactic-scale star formation and
 supermassive black hole growth, and relate our results to
 the star formation conditions in other extreme
 environments.},

  Abstract                 = {This review deals with the winds from "normal" hot stars
 such as O-stars, B- and A-supergiants, and Central Stars of
 Planetary Nebulae with O-type spectra. The advanced
 diagnostic methods of stellar winds, including an
 assessment of the accuracy of the determinations of global
 stellar wind parameters (terminal velocities, mass-loss
 rates, wind momenta, and energies), are introduced and
 scaling relations as a function of stellar parameters are
 provided. Observational results are interpreted in the
 framework of the stationary, one-dimensional (1-D) theory
 of line-driven winds. Systematic effects caused by
 nonhomogeneous structures, time dependence, and deviations
 from spherical symmetry are discussed. The review finishes
 with a brief description of the role of stellar winds as
 extragalactic distance indicators and as tracers of the
 chemical composition of galaxies at high redshift.},

 pulsars associated with neutron stars in globular clusters
 indicates that several hundred stellar black holes of about
 10 solar masses each can form within a typical cluster.
 While, in clusters of high central density, the rapid
 dynamical evolution of the black-hole population leads to
 an ejection of nearly all holes on a short timescale,
 systems of intermediate density may involve a normal star's
 capture by one of the surviving holes to form a low-mass
 X-ray binary. One or more such binaries may be found in the
 globular clusters surrounding our galaxy.},

  Abstract                 = {We present two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of slowly rotating gas that is under the influence of the gravity of a super massive black hole and is irradiated by a thin UV accretion disc and a spherical X-ray corona. We calculate the accretion luminosity of a system based on the accretion rate which is assumed to be equal to the mass supply rate at the radius of ~10-2 pc. For the models with high-temperature gas at large radii (~10 pc) and high luminosities, we find a strong correlation between the mass outflow rate and the luminosity (L). The power-law index (q) describing the relation is q = 2.0(+/-0.1), which is very similar to that for radiation-driven stellar and disc wind models. More surprisingly, for high density at large radii, we find steady-state solutions with the accretion luminosity exceeding the Eddington limit. The super-Eddington accretion proceeds in the equatorial region and is possible because the radiation flux from the disc is significantly reduced in the equatorial direction due to the geometrical foreshortening effect. In all models, an outflow is driven from an inflow with sub-Keplerian rotation. For high temperature at large radii, the inflow occurs over a wide range of the polar angles, and the outflow occurs in a relatively narrow polar cone. However, for the super-Eddington cases with low temperature at large radii, the inflow persists only very close to the equatorial plane, resembling a thin accretion disc, while the outflow arises in a wide range of radii and polar angles. The geometry of this extreme inflow-outflow solution is very similar to a radiation-driven wind from a luminous Keplerian accretion disc. For the cold super-Eddington solutions, is only very weakly correlated with L, i.e. 0 <~ q <~ 0.2. This weaker correlation is mainly caused by a mismatch between the direction of escaping photons and the inflowing gas: the radiation is emitted mostly in the polar directions whereas the inflowing gas occurs mainly in the equatorial region.},

 is estimated that 25 percent of the tidally captured

 clusters), while about 50 percent are expected to become
 mergers for rms velocity of roughly 300 km/s (typical for

  Abstract                 = {We present direct constraints on how the formation of
 low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) populations in galactic fields
 depends on stellar age. In this pilot study, we utilize
 Chandra and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data to detect and
 characterize the X-ray point source populations of three
 nearby early-type galaxies: NGC 3115, 3379, and 3384. The
 luminosity-weighted stellar ages of our sample span â‰ˆ3-10
 Gyr. X-ray binary population synthesis models predict that
 the field LMXBs associated with younger stellar populations
 should be more numerous and luminous per unit stellar mass
 than older populations due to the evolution of LMXB donor
 star masses. Crucially, the combination of deep Chandra and
 HST observations allows us to test directly this prediction
 by identifying and removing counterparts to X-ray point
 sources that are unrelated to the field LMXB populations,
 including LMXBs that are formed dynamically in globular
 clusters, Galactic stars, and background active galactic
 nuclei/galaxies. We find that the "young" early-type galaxy
 NGC 3384 (â‰ˆ2-5 Gyr) has an excess of luminous field LMXBs
 (L X >~ (5-10) Ã— 1037 erg s-1) per unit K-band luminosity
 (LK ; a proxy for stellar mass) than the "old" early-type
 galaxies NGC 3115 and 3379 (â‰ˆ8-10 Gyr), which results in
 a factor of â‰ˆ2-3 excess of L X/LK for NGC 3384. This
 result is consistent with the X-ray binary population
 synthesis model predictions; however, our small galaxy
 sample size does not allow us to draw definitive
 conclusions on the evolution field LMXBs in general. We
 discuss how future surveys of larger galaxy samples that
 combine deep Chandra and HST data could provide a powerful
 new benchmark for calibrating X-ray binary population
 synthesis models.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the origins of enigmatic stellar populations
 in four Local Group galactic nuclei, specifically the Milky
 Way, M31, M32 and M33. These are centrally concentrated
 blue stars, found in three out of the four nuclear star
 clusters (NSCs) considered here. Their origins are unknown,
 but could include blue straggler (BS) stars, extended
 horizontal branch stars and young recently formed stars.
 Here, we calculate order-of-magnitude estimates for various
 collision rates, as a function of the host NSC environment
 and distance from the cluster centre. These rates are
 sufficiently high that BSs, formed via collisions between
 main-sequence (MS) stars, could contribute non-negligibly
 (Ëœ1-10 per cent in mass) to every surface brightness
 profile, with the exception of the Milky Way. Stellar
 evolution models show that the envelopes of red giant
 branch (RGB) stars must be nearly completely stripped to
 significantly affect their photometric appearance, which
 requires multiple collisions. Hence, the collision rates
 for individual RGB stars are only sufficiently high in the
 inner â‰²0.1 pc of M31 and M32 for RGB destruction to
 occur. Collisions between white dwarfs and MS stars, which
 should ablate the stars, could offer a steady and
 significant supply of gas in every NSC in our sample. The
 gas could either fragment to form new stars, or accrete on
 to old MS stars already present. Thus, collisional
 processes could contribute significantly to the observed
 blue excesses in M31 and M33; future studies should be
 aimed at better constraining theoretical predictions to
 compliment existing and future observational data.},

  Abstract                 = {We assess the contribution of dynamical hardening by direct three-body scattering interactions to the rate of stellar-mass black hole binary (BHB) mergers in galactic nuclei. We derive an analytic model for the single-binary encounter rate in a nucleus with spherical and disc components hosting a super-massive black hole (SMBH). We determine the total number of encounters NGW needed to harden a BHB to the point that inspiral due to gravitational wave emission occurs before the next three-body scattering event. This is done independently for both the spherical and disc components. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we refine our calculations for NGW to include gravitational wave emission between scattering events. For astrophysically plausible models, we find that typically NGW ? 10. We find two separate regimes for the efficient dynamical hardening of BHBs: (1) spherical star clusters with high central densities, low-velocity dispersions, and no significant Keplerian component and (2) migration traps in discs around SMBHs lacking any significant spherical stellar component in the vicinity of the migration trap, which is expected due to effective orbital inclination reduction of any spherical population by the disc. We also find a weak correlation between the ratio of the second-order velocity moment to velocity dispersion in galactic nuclei and the rate of BHB mergers, where this ratio is a proxy for the ratio between the rotation- and dispersion-supported components. Because discs enforce planar interactions that are efficient in hardening BHBs, particularly in migration traps, they have high merger rates that can contribute significantly to the rate of BHB mergers detected by the advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.},

  Abstract                 = {We present late time multi-wavelength observations of
 Swift J1644+57, suggested to be a relativistic tidal
 disruption flare (TDF). Our observations extend to >4 years
 from discovery and show that 1.4 years after outburst the
 relativistic jet switched off on a timescale less than tens
 of days, corresponding to a power-law decay faster than
 t-70. Beyond this point weak X-rays continue to be detected
 at an approximately constant luminosity of LX Ëœ 5 Ã— 1042
 erg s-1 and are marginally inconsistent with a continuing
 decay of t-5/3, similar to that seen prior to the
 switch-off. Host photometry enables us to infer a black
 hole mass of MBH = 3 Ã— 106 M&sun;, consistent with the
 late time X-ray luminosity arising from sub-Eddington
 accretion onto the black hole in the form of either an
 unusually optically faint active galactic nucleus or a
 slowly varying phase of the transient. Optical/IR
 observations show a clear bump in the light curve at
 timescales of 30-50 days, with a peak magnitude (corrected
 for host galaxy extinction) of MR Ëœ -22 to -23. The
 luminosity of the bump is significantly higher than seen in
 other, non-relativistic TDFs and does not match any
 re-brightening seen at X-ray or radio wavelengths. Its
 luminosity, light curve shape, and spectrum are broadly
 similar to those seen in superluminous supervnovae,
 although subject to large uncertainties in the correction
 of the significant host extinction. We discuss these
 observations in the context of both TDF and massive star
 origins for Swift J1644+5734 and other candidate
 relativistic tidal flares.},

  Abstract                 = {We present comprehensive multiwavelength observations of
 three gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with durations of several
 thousand seconds. We demonstrate that these events are
 extragalactic transients; in particular, we resolve the
 long-standing conundrum of the distance of GRB 101225A (the
 "Christmas-day burst"), finding it to have a redshift z =
 0.847 and showing that two apparently similar events (GRB
 111209A and GRB 121027A) lie at z = 0.677 and z = 1.773,
 respectively. The systems show extremely unusual X-ray and
 optical light curves, very different from classical GRBs,
 with long-lasting, highly variable X-ray emission and
 optical light curves that exhibit little correlation with
 the behavior seen in the X-ray. Their host galaxies are
 faint, compact, and highly star-forming dwarf galaxies,
 typical of "blue compact galaxies." We propose that these
 bursts are the prototypes of a hitherto largely
 unrecognized population of ultra-long GRBs, which while
 observationally difficult to detect may be astrophysically
 relatively common. The long durations may naturally be
 explained by the engine-driven explosions of stars of much
 larger radii than normally considered for GRB progenitors,
 which are thought to have compact Wolf-Rayet progenitor
 stars. However, we cannot unambiguously identify supernova
 signatures within their light curves or spectra. We also
 consider the alternative possibility that they arise from
 the tidal disruption of stars by massive black holes and
 conclude that the associated timescales are only consistent
 with the disruption of compact stars (e.g., white dwarfs)
 by black holes of relatively low mass (<105 M ?).},

  Abstract                 = {We present analytic flux prescriptions for broad-band
 spectra of self-absorbed and optically thin synchrotron
 radiation from gamma-ray burst afterglows, based on 1D
 relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. By treating the
 evolution of critical spectrum parameters as a power-law
 break between the ultrarelativistic and non-relativistic
 asymptotic solutions, we generalize the prescriptions to
 any observer time. Our aim is to provide a set of formulas
 that constitutes a useful tool for accurate fitting of
 model parameters to observational data, regardless of the
 dynamical phase of the outflow. The applicability range is
 not confined to gamma-ray burst afterglows, but includes
 all spherical outflows (also jets before the jet-break)
 that produce synchrotron radiation as they adiabatically
 decelerate in a cold, power-law medium. We test the
 accuracy of the prescriptions and show that numerical
 evidence suggests that typical relative errors in the
 derivation of physical quantities are about 10 per cent. A
 software implementation of the presented flux prescriptions
 combined with a fitting code is freely available on request
 and online.1 Together they can be used in order to directly
 fit model parameters to data.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a scenario in which massive stars form at the
 outer edges of an AGN accretion disc. We analyze the
 dynamics of a disc forming around a supermassive black
 hole, in which the angular momentum is transported by
 turbulence induced by the disc's self-gravity. We find that
 once the surface density of the disc exceeds a critical
 value, the disc fragments into dense clumps. The biggest
 clumps collapse and form massive stars, which produce
 few-tens-solar-mass black holes at the end of their
 evolution. The embedded black holes will interact
 gravitationally with the massive accretion disc and be
 dragged towards the central black hole. Merger of a
 disc-born black hole with the central black hole will
 produce a burst of gravitational waves. If the central
 black hole is accreting at a rate comparable to the
 Eddington limit, the gas drag from the accretion disc will
 not alter significantly the dynamics of the final year of
 merger, and the gravitational waves should be observable by
 LISA. We argue that for a reasonable range of parameters
 such mergers will be detected monthly, and that the
 gravitational-wave signal from these mergers is distinct
 from that of other merger scenarios. Also, for some
 plausible black hole masses and accretion rates, the burst
 of gravitational waves should be accompanied by a
 detectable change in the optical luminosity of the central
 engine.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a multiwavelength investigation of the
 circumnuclear environment of the Andromeda galaxy (M31),
 utilizing archival Chandra, FUSE, GALEX, HST and Spitzer
 data as well as ground-based observations. Based on the
 Chandra/ACIS data, we tightly constrain the X-ray
 luminosity of M31*, the central supermassive black hole
 (SMBH) of the galaxy, to be L0.3-7keV <~ 1.2 Ã— 1036ergs-1,
 approximately one part per 1010 of the Eddington
 luminosity. From the diffuse X-ray emission, we
 characterize the circumnuclear hot gas with a temperature
 of ~0.3 keV and a density of ~0.1cm-3. In the absence of an
 active SMBH and recent star formation, the most likely
 heating source for the hot gas is Type Ia supernovae (SNe).
 The presence of cooler, dusty gas residing in a nuclear
 spiral has long been known in terms of optical line
 emission and extinction. We further reveal the infrared
 emission of the nuclear spiral and evaluate the relative
 importance of various possible ionizing sources. We show
 evidence for interaction between the nuclear spiral and the
 hot gas, probably via thermal evaporation. This mechanism
 lends natural understandings to (1) the inactivity of M31*,
 in spite of a probably continuous supply of gas from outer
 disc regions and (2) the launch of a bulge outflow of hot
 gas, primarily mass-loaded from the circumnuclear regions.
 One particular prediction of such a scenario is the
 presence of gas with intermediate temperatures arising from
 the conductive interfaces. The FUSE observations do show
 strong OVIlambda1032 and lambda1038 absorption lines
 against the bulge starlight, but the effective column
 density, NOVI ~ 4 Ã— 1014cm-2, may be attributed to
 foreground gas located in the bulge and/or the highly
 inclined disc of M31, leaving the amount of circumnuclear
 gas with intermediate temperatures largely uncertain. Our
 study strongly argues that stellar feedback, particularly
 in the form of energy release from SNe Ia, may play an
 important role in regulating the evolution of SMBHs and the
 interstellar medium in galactic bulges.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider stable mass transfer from the secondary to the
 primary of an extreme mass ratio binary system. We show
 that when the mass transfer is sufficiently fast, mass
 leakage occurs through the outer Lagrange point L2, in
 addition to the usual transfer through L1. We provide an
 analytical estimate for the mass leakage rate through L2
 and find the conditions in which it is comparable to the
 mass transfer rate through L1. Focusing on a binary system
 of a main-sequence star and a supermassive black hole,
 driven by the emission of gravitational radiation, we show
 that it may sustain stable mass transfer, along with
 mass-loss through L2. If such a mass transferring system
 occurs at our Galactic Centre, it produces a gravitational
 wave signal detectable by future detectors, such as Laser
 Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The signal evolves
 according to the star's adiabatic index and cooling time.
 For low-mass stars, the evolution is faster than the
 Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling rate driving the star out of the
 main-sequence. In some cases, the frequency and amplitude
 of the signal may both decrease with time, contrary to the
 standard chirp of a coalescing binary. Mass-loss through
 L2, when occurs, decreases the evolution time-scale of the
 emitted gravitational wave signal by up to a few tens of
 per cent. We conclude that L2 mass ejection is a crucial
 factor in analysing gravitational waves signals produced by
 such systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Unambiguous detection of the tidal disruption of a star
 would allow an assessment of the presence and masses of
 supermassive black holes in quiescent galaxies. It would
 also provide invaluable information on bulge-scale stellar
 processes (such as two-body relaxation) via the rate at
 which stars are injected into the tidal sphere of influence
 of the black holes. This rate, in turn, is essential to
 predict gravitational radiation emission by compact object
 inspirals. The signature of a tidal disruption event is
 thought to be a fallback rate for the stellar debris on to
 the black hole that decreases as t-5/3. This mass flux is
 often assumed to yield a luminous signal that decreases in
 time at the same rate. In this paper, we calculate the
 monochromatic light curves arising from such an accretion
 event. Differently from previous studies, we adopt a more
 realistic description of the fallback rate and of the
 super-Eddington accretion physics. We also provide
 simultaneous light curves in optical, ultraviolet (UV) and
 X-rays. We show that, after a few months, optical and UV
 light curves scale as t-5/12, and are thus substantially
 flatter than the t-5/3 behaviour, which is a prerogative of
 the bolometric light curve, only. At earlier times and for
 black hole masses <107 M&sun;, the wind emission dominates:
 after reaching a peak of 1041-1043 erg s-1 at roughly a
 month, the light curve decreases steeply as Ëœt-2.6, until
 the disc contribution takes over. The X-ray band, instead,
 is the best place to detect the t-5/3`smoking gun'
 behaviour, although it is displayed only for roughly a
 year, before the emission steepens exponentially.},

  Abstract                 = {The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way
 plays host to a massive, young cluster that may have formed
 in one of the most inhospitable environments in the Galaxy.
 We present new measurements of the global properties of
 this cluster, including the initial mass function (IMF),
 age, and cluster mass. These results are based on Keck
 laser-guide-star adaptive optics observations used to
 identify the young stars and measure their Kp-band
 luminosity function as presented in Do et al. A Bayesian
 inference methodology is developed to simultaneously fit
 the global properties of the cluster utilizing the
 observations and extensive simulations of synthetic star
 clusters. We find that the slope of the mass function for
 this cluster is alpha = 1.7 $\pm$ 0.2, which is steeper
 than previously reported, but still flatter than the
 traditional Salpeter slope of 2.35. The age of the cluster
 is between 2.5 and 5.8 Myr with 95% confidence, which is a
 younger age than typically adopted but consistent within
 the uncertainties of past measurements. The exact age of
 the cluster is difficult to determine since our results
 show two distinct age solutions (3.9 Myr and 2.8 Myr) due
 to model degeneracies in the relative number of Wolf-Rayet
 and OB stars. The total cluster mass is between 14,000 and
 37,000 M &sun; above 1 M &sun; and it is necessary to
 include multiple star systems in order to fit the observed
 luminosity function and the number of observed Wolf-Rayet
 stars. The new IMF slope measurement is now consistent with
 X-ray observations indicating a factor of 10 fewer X-ray
 emitting pre-main-sequence stars than expected when
 compared with a Salpeter IMF. The young cluster at the
 Galactic center is one of the few definitive examples of an
 IMF that deviates significantly from the near-universal
 IMFs found in the solar neighborhood.},

 circumnuclear region of M87 at three different locations,
 with a spatial sampling of 0.028" using the Faint Object
 Camera f/48 spectrograph on board HST. These data allow us
 to determine the rotation curve of the inner ~1" of the
 ionized gas disk in [O II] ?3727 to a distance as close as
 0.07" (~=5 pc) to the dynamic center, thereby significantly
 improving on both the spatial resolution and coverage of
 previous FOS observations. We have modeled the kinematics
 of the gas under the assumption of the existence of both a
 central black hole and an extended central mass
 distribution, taking into account the effects of the
 instrumental PSF, the intrinsic luminosity distribution of
 the line, and the finite size of the slit. We find that the
 central mass must be concentrated within a sphere whose
 maximum radius is 0.05" (~=3.5 pc) and show that both the
 observed rotation curve and line profiles are consistent
 with a thin disk in Keplerian motion. We conclude that the
 most likely explanation for the observed motions is the
 presence of a supermassive black hole and derive a value of
 MBH = (3.2 +/- 0.9) ?109 M? for its mass. Based on

  Abstract                 = {We present a two-dimensional grid-based hydrodynamic
 simulation of a thin, viscous, locally isothermal
 corotating disk orbiting an equal-mass Newtonian binary
 point mass on a fixed circular orbit. We study the
 structure of the disk after multiple viscous times. The
 binary maintains a central hole in the viscously relaxed
 disk with radius equal to about twice the binary semimajor
 axis. Disk surface density within the hole is reduced by
 orders of magnitude relative to the density in the disk
 bulk. The inner truncation of the disk resembles the
 clearing of a gap in a protoplanetary disk. An initially
 circular disk becomes elliptical and then eccentric.
 Disturbances in the disk contain a component that is
 stationary in the rotating frame in which the binary is at
 rest; this component is a two-armed spiral density wave. We
 measure the distribution of the binary torque in the disk
 and find that the strongest positive torque is exerted
 inside the central low-density hole. We make connection
 with the linear theory of disk forcing at outer Lindblad
 resonances (OLRs) and find that the measured torque density
 distribution is consistent with forcing at the 3:2 (m=2)
 OLR, well within the central hole. We also measure the time
 dependence of the rate at which gas accretes across the
 hole and find quasi-periodic structure. We discuss

  Abstract                 = {In this study we present the results from realistic N-body modelling of massive star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. We have computed eight simulations with N ~ 105 particles; six of these were evolved for at least a Hubble time. The aim of this modelling is to examine in detail the possibility of large-scale core expansion in massive star clusters, and search for a viable dynamical origin for the radius-age trend observed for such objects in the Magellanic Clouds. We identify two physical processes which can lead to significant and prolonged cluster core expansion - mass-loss due to rapid stellar evolution in a primordially mass-segregated cluster, and heating due to a retained population of stellar mass black holes, formed in the supernova explosions of the most massive cluster stars. These two processes operate over different time-scales and during different periods of a cluster's life. The former occurs only at early times and cannot drive core expansion for longer than a few hundred Myr, while the latter typically does not begin until several hundred Myr have passed, but can result in core expansion lasting for many Gyr. We investigate the behaviour of each of these expansion mechanisms under different circumstances - in clusters with varying degrees of primordial mass segregation, and in clusters with varying black hole retention fractions. In combination, the two processes can lead to a wide variety of evolutionary paths on the radius-age plane, which fully cover the observed cluster distribution and hence define a dynamical origin for the radius-age trend in the Magellanic Clouds. We discuss in some detail the implications of core expansion for various aspects of globular cluster research, as well as the possibility of observationally inferring the presence of a significant population of stellar mass black holes in a cluster.},

  Abstract                 = {In some galaxies, the stars orbiting the supermassive black hole take the form of an eccentric nuclear disk, in which every star is on a coherent, apsidally aligned orbit. The most famous example of an eccentric nuclear disk is the double nucleus of Andromeda, and there is strong evidence for many more in the local universe. Despite their apparent ubiquity, however, a dynamical explanation for their longevity has remained a mystery: differential precession should wipe out large-scale apsidal-alignment on a short timescale. Here we identify a new dynamical mechanism which stabilizes eccentric nuclear disks, and explain for the first time the negative eccentricity gradient seen in the Andromeda nucleus. The stabilizing mechanism drives oscillations of the eccentricity vectors of individual orbits, both in direction (about the mean body of the disk) and in magnitude. Combined with the negative eccentricity gradient, the eccentricity oscillations push some stars near the inner edge of the disk extremely close to the black hole, potentially leading to tidal disruption events (TDEs). Order of magnitude calculations predict extremely high rates in recently formed eccentric nuclear disks (?0.1?1 {{yr}}-1 {{gal}}-1). Unless the stellar disks are replenished, these rates should decrease with time as the disk depletes in mass. If eccentric nuclear disks form during gas-rich major mergers, this may explain the preferential occurrence of TDEs in recently merged and post-merger (E+A/K+A) galaxies.},

  Abstract                 = {Theory suggests that a star making a close passage by a
 supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy can under
 most circumstances be expected to emit a giant flare of
 radiation as it is disrupted and a portion of the resulting
 stream of shock-heated stellar debris falls back onto the
 black hole itself. We examine the first results of an
 ongoing archival survey of galaxy clusters using Chandra
 and XMM-Newton-selected data and report a likely tidal
 disruption flare from SDSS J131122.15-012345.6 in A1689.
 The flare is observed to vary by a factor of gsim30 over at
 least two years to have maximum LX (0.3-3.0 keV) >~ 5 Ã—
 1042 erg s-1 and to emit as a blackbody with kT ~ 0.12 keV.

  Abstract                 = {On 2011 March 28, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope
 triggered on an object that had no analog in over six years
 of Swift operations. Follow-up observations by the Swift
 X-ray Telescope (XRT) found a new, bright X-ray source
 covering three orders of magnitude in flux over the first
 few days, that was much more persistent (and variable) than
 gamma-ray burst afterglows. Ground-based spectroscopy found
 a redshift of 0.35, implying extremely high luminosity,
 with integrated isotropic-equivalent energy output in the
 X-ray band alone exceeding 1053 erg in the first two weeks
 after discovery. Strong evidence for a collimated outflow
 or beamed emission was found. The observational properties
 of this object are unlike anything ever before observed. We
 interpret these unique properties as the result of emission
 from a relativistic jet produced in the aftermath of the
 tidal disruption of a main sequence star by a massive black
 hole (BH) in the center of the host galaxy. The source
 decayed slowly as the stellar remnants were accreted onto
 the BH, before abruptly shutting off. Here we present the
 definitive XRT team light curve for Swift J164449.3+573451
 and discuss its implications. We show that the unabsorbed
 flux decayed roughly as a {t}-1.5 power law up to 2012
 August 17. The steep turnoff of an order of magnitude in 24
 hr seems to be consistent with the shutdown of the jet as
 the accretion disk transitioned from a thick disk to a thin
 disk. Swift continues to monitor this source in case the
 jet reactivates.},

  Abstract                 = {The centers of most known galaxies host supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In orbit around these black holes are a centrally concentrated distribution of stars, both in single and in binary systems. Occasionally, these stars are perturbed onto orbits that bring them close to the SMBH. If the star is in a binary system, the three-body interaction with the SMBH can lead to large changes in orbital energy, depositing one of the two stars on a tightly-bound orbit, and its companion into a hyperbolic orbit that may escape the galaxy. In this Letter, we show that the disruption of solitary stars can also lead to large positive increases in orbital energy. The kick velocity depends on the amount of mass the star loses at pericenter, but not on the ratio of black hole to stellar mass, and are at most the star's own escape velocity. We find that these kicks are usually too small to result in the ejection of stars from the Milky Way, but can eject the stars from the black hole's sphere of influence, reducing their probability of being disrupted again. We estimate that {\mathord {\sim }} 10^5 stars, {\mathord {\sim }} 1% of all stars within 10 pc of the galactic center, are likely to have had mass removed by the central black hole through tidal interaction, and speculate that these "turbovelocity" stars will at first be redder, but eventually bluer, and always brighter than their unharassed peers.},

  Abstract                 = {We derive the delay-time distribution (DTD) of Type Ia
 supernovae (SNe Ia) using a sample of 132 SNe Ia,
 discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS2) among
 66 000 galaxies with spectral-based star formation
 histories (SFHs). To recover the best-fitting DTD, the SFH
 of every individual galaxy is compared, using Poisson
 statistics, to the number of SNe that it hosted (zero or
 one), based on the method introduced in Maoz et al. This SN
 sample differs from the SDSS2 SN Ia sample analysed by
 Brandt et al., using a related, but different, DTD recovery
 method. Furthermore, we use a simulation-based SN
 detection-efficiency function, and we apply a number of
 important corrections to the galaxy SFHs and SN Ia
 visibility times. The DTD that we find has 4sigma
 detections in all three of its time bins: prompt (tau <
 0.42 Gyr), intermediate (0.42 < tau < 2.4 Gyr) and delayed
 (tau > 2.4 Gyr), indicating a continuous DTD, and it is
 among the most accurate and precise among recent DTD
 reconstructions. The best-fitting power-law form to the
 recovered DTD is t-1.07 $\pm$ 0.07, consistent with generic
 Ëœt-1 predictions of SN Ia progenitor models based on the
 gravitational-wave-induced mergers of binary white dwarfs.
 The time-integrated number of SNe Ia per formed stellar
 mass is NSN/M = 0.00130 $\pm$ 0.00015 M&sun;-1, or about 4
 per cent of the stars formed with initial masses in the 3 -
 8 M&sun; range. This is lower than, but largely consistent
 with, several recent DTD estimates based on SN rates in
 galaxy clusters and in local-volume galaxies, and is higher
 than, but consistent with NSN/M estimated by comparing
 volumetric SN Ia rates to cosmic SFH.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiple observational lines of evidence support a
 connection between hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae
 (SLSNe) and long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Both
 events require a powerful central energy source, usually
 attributed to a millisecond magnetar or an accreting black
 hole. The GRB-SLSN link raises several theoretical
 questions: What distinguishes the engines responsible for
 these different phenomena? Can a single engine power both a
 GRB and a luminous SN in the same event? We propose a new
 unifying model for magnetar thermalization and jet
 formation: misalignment between the rotation (${\bf
 \Omega}$) and magnetic dipole (${\bf \mu}$) axes
 thermalizes a fraction of the spindown power by
 reconnection in the striped equatorial wind, providing a
 guaranteed source of "thermal" emission to power the
 supernova. The remaining un-thermalized power energizes a
 relativistic jet. In this picture, the GRB-SLSN dichotomy
 is directly linked to ${\bf \Omega \cdot \mu}$. We extend
 earlier work to show that even weak relativistic jets of
 luminosity $\sim10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ can escape the
 expanding SN ejecta hours after the explosion, implying
 that escaping relativistic jets may accompany many SLSNe.
 We calculate the observational signature of these jets. We
 show that they may produce transient UV cocoon emission
 lasting a few hours when the jet breaks out of the ejecta
 surface. A longer-lived optical/UV signal may originate
 from a mildly-relativistic wind driven from the interface
 between the jet and the ejecta walls. This provides a new
 explanation for the secondary early-time maximum observed
 in some SLSNe light curves, such as LSQ14bdq. This scenario
 also predicts a population of GRB from on-axis jets with
 extremely long durations, potentially similar to the
 population of "jetted tidal disruption events", in
 coincidence with a small subset of SLSNe.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiple observational lines of evidence support a
 connection between hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae
 (SLSNe) and long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Both
 events require a powerful central energy source, usually
 attributed to a millisecond magnetar or an accreting black
 hole. The GRB-SLSN link raises several theoretical
 questions: What distinguishes the engines responsible for
 these different phenomena? Can a single engine power both a
 GRB and a luminous SN in the same event? We propose a new
 unifying model for magnetar thermalization and jet
 formation: misalignment between the rotation (${\bf

 indicates that all massive galaxies have supermassive black
 holes at their centres. Although the luminosities and
 brightness fluctuations of quasars in the early Universe
 suggest that some were powered by black holes with masses
 greater than 10 billion solar masses, the remnants of these
 objects have not been found in the nearby Universe. The
 giant elliptical galaxy Messier 87 hosts the hitherto most
 massive known black hole, which has a mass of 6.3 billion
 solar masses. Here we report that NGC 3842, the brightest
 galaxy in a cluster at a distance from Earth of 98
 megaparsecs, has a central black hole with a mass of 9.7
 billion solar masses, and that a black hole of comparable
 or greater mass is present in NGC 4889, the brightest
 galaxy in the Coma cluster (at a distance of 103
 megaparsecs). These two black holes are significantly more
 massive than predicted by linearly extrapolating the widely
 used correlations between black-hole mass and the stellar
 velocity dispersion or bulge luminosity of the host galaxy.
 Although these correlations remain useful for predicting
 black-hole masses in less massive elliptical galaxies, our
 measurements suggest that different evolutionary processes
 influence the growth of the largest galaxies and their
 black holes.},

  Abstract                 = {The massive black hole in our Galactic centre, Sgr A*, accretes only a small fraction of the gas available at its Bondi radius. The physical processes determining this accretion rate remain unknown, partly due to a lack of observational constraints on the gas at distances between ?10 and ?105 Schwarzschild radii (Rs) from the black hole. Recent infrared observations identify low-mass gas clouds, G1 and G2, moving on highly eccentric, nearly co-planar orbits through the accretion flow around Sgr A*. Although it is not yet clear whether these objects contain embedded stars, their extended gaseous envelopes evolve independently as gas clouds. In this paper we attempt to use these gas clouds to constrain the properties of the accretion flow at ?103 Rs. Assuming that G1 and G2 follow the same trajectory, we model the small differences in their orbital parameters as evolution resulting from interaction with the background flow. We find evolution consistent with the G-clouds originating in the clockwise disc. Our analysis enables the first unique determination of the rotation axis of the accretion flow: we localize the rotation axis to within 20°, finding an orientation consistent with the parsec-scale jet identified in X-ray observations and with the circumnuclear disc, a massive torus of molecular gas ?1.5 pc from Sgr A*. This suggests that the gas in the accretion flow comes predominantly from the circumnuclear disc, rather than the winds of stars in the young clockwise disc. This result will be tested by the Event-Horizon Telescope within the next year. Our model also makes testable predictions for the orbital evolution of G1 and G2, falsifiable on a 5-10 year time-scale.},

 for stars orbiting a supermassive black hole (SBH) at the

 detail in an earlier paper, includes diffusion coefficients
 that describe the effects of both random (``classical'')
 and correlated (``resonant'') encounters. Steady-state
 solutions are similar to the Bahcall-Wolf solution,
 n(r)\propto {{r}-7/4}, but are modified at small radii due
 to the higher rate of diffusion in angular momentum, which
 results in a low-density core. The core radius is a few
 percent of the influence radius of the SBH. The
 corresponding phase-space density f(E,L) drops nearly to
 zero at low energies, implying almost no stars on tightly
 bound orbits about the SBH. Steady-state rates of stellar
 disruption are presented, and a simple analytic expression
 is found that reproduces the numerical feeding rates with
 good accuracy. The distribution of periapsides of disrupted
 stars is computed. Time-dependent solutions, f(E,L,t), are
 also computed, starting from initial conditions similar to
 those produced by a binary SBH. In these models, feeding
 rates evolve on two timescales: rapid evolution during
 which the region evacuated by the massive binary is
 refilled by angular-momentum diffusion; and slower
 evolution as diffusion in energy causes the density profile
 at large radii to attain the Bahcall-Wolf form.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivated by recent observations that suggest a low
 density of old stars around the Milky Way supermassive
 black hole (SMBH), models for the nuclear star cluster are
 considered that have not yet reached a steady state under
 the influence of gravitational encounters. A core of
 initial radius 1-1.5 pc evolves to a size of approximately
 0.5 pc after 10 Gyr, roughly the size of the observed core.
 The absence of a Bahcall-Wolf cusp is naturally explained
 in these models, without the need for fine-tuning or
 implausible initial conditions. In the absence of a cusp,
 the time for a 10 M sun black hole (BH) to spiral in to the
 Galactic center from an initial distance of 5 pc can be
 much greater than 10 Gyr. Assuming that the stellar BHs had
 the same phase-space distribution initially as the stars,
 their density after 5-10 Gyr is predicted to rise very
 steeply going into the stellar core, but could remain
 substantially below the densities inferred from
 steady-state models that include a steep density cusp in
 the stars. Possible mechanisms for the creation of the
 parsec-scale initial core include destruction of stars on
 centrophilic orbits in a pre-existing triaxial nucleus,
 inhibited star formation near the SMBH, or ejection of
 stars by a massive binary. The implications of these models
 are discussed for the rates of gravitational-wave inspiral
 events, as well as other physical processes that depend on
 a high density of stars or stellar-mass BHs near SgrA*.},

  Abstract                 = {Two-body relaxation times of nuclear star clusters are short enough that gravitational encounters should substantially affect their structure in 10 Gyr or less. In nuclear star clusters without massive black holes, dynamical evolution is a competition between core collapse, which causes densities to increase, and heat input from the surrounding galaxy, which causes densities to decrease. The maximum extent of a nucleus that can resist expansion is derived numerically for a wide range of initial conditions; observed nuclei are shown to be compact enough to resist expansion, although there may have been an earlier generation of low-density nuclei that were dissolved. An evolutionary model for NGC 205 is presented which suggests that the nucleus of this galaxy has already undergone core collapse. Adding a massive black hole to a nucleus inhibits core collapse, and nuclear star clusters with black holes always expand, due primarily to heat input from the galaxy and secondarily to heating from stellar disruptions. The expansion rate is smaller for larger black holes due to the smaller temperature difference between galaxy and nucleus when the black hole is large. The rate of stellar tidal disruptions and its variation with time are computed for a variety of initial models. The disruption rate generally decreases with time due to the evolving nuclear density, particularly in the faintest galaxies, assuming that scaling relations derived for luminous galaxies can be extended to low luminosities.},

 mergers as the black holes from the two galaxies fall to
 the center of the merged system and form a bound pair. The
 two black holes will eventually coalesce in an enormous
 burst of gravitational radiation. Here we show that the
 orientation of a black hole's spin axis would change
 dramatically even in a minor merger, leading to a sudden
 flip in the direction of any associated jet. We identify
 the winged or X-type radio sources with galaxies in which
 this has occurred. The inferred coalescence rate is similar
 to the overall galaxy merger rate, implying that of the
 order of one merger event per year could be detected by
 gravitational wave interferometers.},

 central black hole via gravitational scattering onto low
 angular momentum orbits. Higher feeding rates are possible
 if the gravitational potential near the black hole is
 nonaxisymmetric and the orbits are chaotic. Motivated by
 recently published, self-consistent models, we evaluate
 rates of stellar capture and disruption in triaxial nuclei.
 Rates are found to substantially exceed those in
 collisionally resupplied loss cones, as long as an
 appreciable fraction of the orbits are centrophilic. The
 mass captured by a black hole after a given time in a steep
 ($\rho$\~{}r-2) nucleus scales as $\sigma$5 with $\sigma$
 the stellar velocity dispersion, and the accumulated mass
 in 1010 yr is of the correct order to reproduce the
 M*-$\sigma$ relation. Triaxiality can solve the ``final
 parsec problem'' of decaying black hole binaries by
 increasing the flux of stars into the binary's loss cone.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent measurements by the Pierre Auger Observatory
 suggest that the composition of ultrahigh energy cosmic
 rays (UHECRs) becomes dominated by heavy nuclei at high
 energies. However, until now there has been no
 astrophysical motivation for considering a source highly
 enriched in heavy elements. Here we demonstrate that the
 outflows from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may indeed be
 composed primarily of nuclei with masses AËœ 40-200, which
 are synthesized as hot material expands away from the
 central engine. In particular, if the jet is magnetically
 dominated (rather than a thermally driven fireball) its low
 entropy enables heavy elements to form efficiently.
 Adopting the millisecond protomagnetar model for the GRB
 central engine, we show that heavy nuclei both are
 synthesized in protomagnetar winds and can in principle be
 accelerated to energies â‰³1020 eV in the shocks or regions
 of magnetic reconnection that are responsible for powering
 the GRB. Similar results may apply to accretion-powered GRB
 models if the jet originates from a magnetized disc wind.
 Depending on the precise distribution of nuclei
 synthesized, we predict that the average primary mass may
 continue to increase beyond Fe group elements at the
 highest energies, possibly reaching the Aâ‰ˆ 90
 (zirconium), Aâ‰ˆ 130 (tellurium) or even Aâ‰ˆ 195
 (platinum) peaks. Future measurements of the UHECR
 composition at energies â‰³1020 eV can thus confirm or
 constrain our model and, potentially, probe the nature of
 GRB outflows. The longer attenuation length of ultra-heavy
 nuclei through the extragalactic background light greatly
 expands the volume of accessible sources and alleviates the
 energetic constraints on GRBs as the source of UHECRs.},

  Abstract                 = {When a star is tidally disrupted by a supermassive black
 hole (SMBH), roughly half of its mass falls back to the
 SMBH at super-Eddington rates. As this gas is tenuously
 gravitationally bound and unable to cool radiatively, only
 a small fraction fin â‰ª 1 may accrete, with the majority
 instead becoming unbound in an outflow of velocity Ëœ104 km
 s-1. The outflow spreads laterally as it expands to large
 radii, encasing the SMBH and blocking the inner disc's
 EUV/X-ray radiation, which becomes trapped in a
 radiation-dominated nebula. Ionizing nebular radiation
 heats the inner edge of the ejecta, converting the emission
 to optical/near-UV wavelengths where photons more readily
 escape due to the lower opacity. This can explain the
 unexpectedly low and temporally constant effective
 temperatures of optically discovered tidal disruption event
 (TDE) flares. For high-mass SMBHs, M* â‰³ 107 M&sun;, the
 ejecta can become fully ionized at an earlier stage, or for
 a wider range of viewing angles, producing a TDE flare
 accompanied by thermal X-ray emission. The peak optical
 luminosity is suppressed as the result of adiabatic losses
 in the inner disc wind when M* â‰ª 107 M&sun;, possibly
 contributing to the unexpected dearth of optical TDEs in
 galaxies with low-mass SMBHs. In the classical picture,
 where fin â‰ˆ 1, TDEs de-spin supermassive SMBHs and cap
 their maximum spins well below theoretical accretion
 physics limits. This cap is relaxed in our model, and
 existing Fe Kalpha spin measurements provide preliminary
 evidence that fin < 1.},

  Abstract                 = {The impending era of wide-field radio surveys has the
 potential to revolutionize our understanding of
 astrophysical transients. Here we evaluate the prospects of
 a wide range of planned and hypothetical radio surveys
 using the properties and volumetric rates of known and
 hypothetical classes of extragalactic synchrotron radio
 transients (e.g., on-axis and off-axis gamma-ray bursts
 (GRBs), supernovae, tidal disruption events, compact object
 mergers). Utilizing these sources and physically motivated
 considerations we assess the allowed phase space of radio
 luminosity and peak timescale for extragalactic transients.
 We also include for the first time effects such as redshift
 evolution of the rates, K-corrections, and non-Euclidean
 luminosity distance, which affect the detection rates of
 the most sensitive surveys. The number of detected events
 is calculated by means of a Monte Carlo method, using the
 various survey properties (depth, cadence, area) and
 realistic detection criteria that include a cut on the
 minimum variability of the transients during the survey and
 an assessment of host galaxy contamination. We find that
 near-term GHz frequency surveys (ASKAP/VAST, Very Large
 Array Sky Survey) will detect few events: â‰² 30-50 on- and
 off-axis long GRBs (LGRBs) and off-axis tidal disruption
 events, and ~ 50-100 neutron star binary mergers if ~ 0.5%
 of the mergers result in a stable millisecond magnetar.
 Low-frequency surveys (e.g., LOFAR) are unlikely to detect
 any transients, while a hypothetical large-scale mm survey
 may detect ~40 on-axis LGRBs. On the other hand, we find
 that SKA1 surveys at ~ 0.1-1 GHz have the potential to
 uncover thousands of transients, mainly on-axis and
 off-axis LGRBs, on-axis short GRBs, off-axis TDEs, and
 neutron star binary mergers with magnetar remnants.},

 The disk is treated as a continuous network of oscillators,
 one being in resonance with the satellite. Momentum and
 continuity equations are defined for the torque and account
 is taken of the effects of friction and unsteadiness on the
 torque, and of pressure, viscosity and self-gravitation on

 dominate the magnitude of the torque, while physical

  Abstract                 = {Grids of models of massive stars (M >= 20 M&sun;) with
 rotation are computed for metallicities Z ranging from that
 of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to that of the Galactic
 Centre. The hydrostatic effects of rotation, the rotational
 mixing and the enhancements of the mass loss rates by
 rotation are included. The evolution of the surface
 rotational velocities of the most massive O-stars mainly
 depends on the mass loss rates and thus on the initial Z
 value. The minimum initial mass for a star for entering the
 Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase is lowered by rotation. For all
 metallicities, rotating stars enter the WR phase at an
 earlier stage of evolution and the WR lifetimes are
 increased, mainly as a result of the increased duration of
 the eWNL phase. Models of WR stars predict in general
 rather low rotation velocities (<50 km s-1) with a few
 possible exceptions, particularly at metallicities lower
 than solar where WR star models have in general faster
 rotation and more chance to reach the break-up limit. The
 properties of the WR populations as predicted by the
 rotating models are in general in much better agreement
 with the observations in nearby galaxies. Some possible
 remaining difficulties in these comparisons are mentioned.
 The evolution of the chemical abundances is largely
 influenced by rotation in all phases from the MS phase to
 the WN and WC phases. We also show that the interval of
 initial masses going through the LBV stage is changing with
 Z and Omega. The observed variation with metallicity of the
 fractions of type Ib/Ic supernovae with respect to type II
 supernovae as found by Prantzos & Boissier (\cite{Pr03}) is
 very well reproduced by the rotating models, while
 non-rotating models predict much too low ratios. This
 indicates that the minimum initial masses of single stars
 going through a WR phase are consistently predicted. At Z =
 0.040, stars with initial masses above 50 M&sun; reach a
 final mass at the time of supernova explosion between 5 and
 7.5 M&sun;, while at Z = 0.004, like in the SMC, the final
 masses of stars are in the range of 17-29 M&sun;. On the
 whole, rotation appears to be an essential parameter even
 for the WR properties. Detailed tables describing the
 evolutionary tracks are available on the web.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the first results from AMUSE-Field, a Chandra
 survey designed to characterize the occurrence and
 intensity of low-level accretion onto supermassive black
 holes (SMBHs) at the center of local early-type field
 galaxies. This is accomplished by means of a Large Program
 targeting a distance-limited (<30 Mpc) sample of 103 early
 types spanning a wide range in stellar masses. We acquired
 new ACIS-S observations for 61 objects down to a limiting
 (0.3-10 keV) luminosity of 2.5 Ã— 1038 erg s-1, and we
 include an additional 42 objects with archival (typically
 deeper) coverage. A nuclear X-ray source is detected in 52
 out of the 103 galaxies. After accounting for potential
 contamination from low-mass X-ray binaries, we estimate
 that the fraction of accreting SMBHs within the sample is
 45% $\pm$ 7%, which sets a firm lower limit on the
 occupation fraction within the field. The measured nuclear
 X-ray luminosities are invariably highly sub-Eddington,
 with L X/L Edd ratios between ~10-4 and 10-8. As also found
 in a companion survey targeting Virgo early types, the
 active fraction increases with increasing host galaxy
 stellar mass, reflective of "Eddington incompleteness"
 within the lower-mass objects. For the Field sample, the
 average nuclear X-ray luminosity scales with the host
 stellar mass as M 0.71 $\pm$ 0.10 star, with an intrinsic
 scatter of 0.73 $\pm$ 0.09 dex. Qualitatively similar
 results hold for morphologically homogeneous (type E) or
 uniform sensitivity (new observations only) subsets. A
 majority of the AMUSE-Field galaxies (78%) inhabit groups,
 enabling us to investigate the influence of group richness
 on nuclear activity. We see no evidence for a positive
 correlation between nuclear X-ray luminosity, normalized to
 host properties, and galaxy density. Rather, while the
 scatter is substantial, it appears that the
 Eddington-scaled X-ray luminosity of group members may be
 slightly lower than for isolated galaxies, and that this
 trend continues to cluster early types.},

  Abstract                 = {Distinct seed formation mechanisms are imprinted upon the
 fraction of dwarf galaxies currently containing a central
 supermassive black hole. Seeding by Pop III remnants is
 expected to produce a higher occupation fraction than is
 generated with direct gas collapse precursors. Chandra
 observations of nearby early-type galaxies can directly
 detect even low-level supermassive black hole activity, and
 the active fraction immediately provides a firm lower limit
 to the occupation fraction. Here, we use the volume-limited
 AMUSE surveys of ~200 optically-selected early-type
 galaxies to characterize simultaneously, for the first
 time, the occupation fraction and the scaling of nuclear
 X-ray luminosity with stellar mass, accounting for
 intrinsic scatter, measurement uncertainties, and X-ray
 limits. For early-type galaxies with log(M_star/M_sun)<10,
 we obtain a lower limit to the occupation fraction of >20%
 (at 95% confidence), but full occupation cannot be
 excluded. The preferred dependence of log(L_X) upon
 log(M_star) has a slope of about 0.7-0.8, consistent with
 the "downsizing" trend previously identified from the AMUSE
 dataset, and a uniform Eddington efficiency is disfavored
 at ~2 sigma. We provide guidelines for the future precision
 with which these parameters may be refined with larger or
 more sensitive samples.},

  Abstract                 = {Context. The fraction of binary stars is an important
 ingredient to interpret globular cluster dynamical
 evolution and their stellar population. Aims: We
 investigate the properties of main-sequence binaries
 measured in a uniform photometric sample of 59 Galactic
 globular clusters that were observed by HST WFC/ACS as a
 part of the Globular Cluster Treasury project. Methods: We
 measured the fraction of binaries and the distribution of
 mass-ratio as a function of radial location within the
 cluster, from the central core to beyond the half-mass
 radius. We studied the radial distribution of binary stars,
 and the distribution of stellar mass ratios. We
 investigated monovariate relations between the fraction of
 binaries and the main parameters of their host clusters.
 Results: We found that in nearly all the clusters, the
 total fraction of binaries is significantly smaller than
 the fraction of binaries in the field, with a few
 exceptions only. Binary stars are significantly more
 centrally concentrated than single MS stars in most of the
 clusters studied in this paper. The distribution of the
 mass ratio is generally flat (for mass-ratio parameter q >
 0.5). We found a significant anti-correlation between the
 binary fraction in a cluster and its absolute luminosity
 (mass). Some, less significant correlation with the
 collisional parameter, the central stellar density, and the
 central velocity dispersion are present. There is no
 statistically significant relation between the binary
 fraction and other cluster parameters. We confirm the
 correlation between the binary fraction and the fraction of
 blue stragglers in the cluster. Tables 1-3 and Appendices

  Abstract                 = {A large fraction of bulgeless disk galaxies contain young
 compact stellar systems at their centers, in spite of the
 local gravitational stability of these disks. We evaluate
 two contrasting hypotheses for the origin of the nuclear
 star clusters in late-type disk galaxies. The clusters
 could not have migrated from distant eccentric locations in
 the disk. Instead they must have formed in situ, requiring
 radial transport of gas toward the center of the disk. This
 transport could be a consequence of the development of the
 magnetorotational instability in the differentially
 rotating warm neutral medium. We evaluate the rate of gas
 transport into the disk center and find that it is
 sufficient to support continuous star formation in that
 location. Enhanced stellar surface brightness in the inner
 few hundred parsecs and the formation of a compact stellar
 system in the central few parsecs are unavoidable in dark
 matter halos with divergent density profiles. We illustrate
 our conclusions on a model of the nearest late-type disk
 galaxy M33.},

  Abstract                 = {The luminosity function of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has been measured down to luminosities ~1042 ergs s-1 in the soft and hard X-rays. Some fraction of this activity is associated with the accretion of the material liberated by the tidal disruption of stars by massive black holes. We estimate the contribution to the X-ray luminosity function from the tidal disruption process. While the contribution depends on a number of poorly known parameters, it appears that it can account for the majority of X-ray-selected AGNs with soft or hard X-ray luminosities <~1043-1044 ergs s-1. If this is correct, a significant portion of the X-ray luminosity function of AGNs is comprised of sources powered by tidal disruption at the faint end, while the sources at the bright end are powered by nonstellar accretion. Black holes with masses <~2×106 Msolar could have acquired most of their present mass by an accretion of tidal debris. In view of the considerable theoretical uncertainty concerning the detailed shape of the light curves of tidal disruption events, we focus on power-law luminosity decay (as identified in candidate tidal disruption events), but we also discuss constant accretion rate models. We expect that the sources associated with thin-disk accretion of circularized tidal debris have peak luminosities of <~1039-1041 ergs s-1, below the luminosity range probed in present surveys.},

  Abstract                 = {The long-term evolution of massive black hole binaries at
 the centers of galaxies is studied in a variety of physical
 regimes, with the aim of resolving the ``final parsec
 problem,'' i.e., how black hole binaries manage to shrink
 to separations at which emission of gravity waves becomes
 efficient. A binary ejects stars by the gravitational
 slingshot and carves out a loss cone in the host galaxy.
 Continued decay of the binary requires a refilling of the
 loss cone. We show that the standard treatment of loss cone
 refilling, derived for collisionally relaxed systems like
 globular clusters, can substantially underestimate the
 refilling rates in galactic nuclei. We derive expressions
 for nonequilibrium loss cone dynamics and calculate
 timescales for the decay of massive black hole binaries
 following galaxy mergers, obtaining significantly higher
 decay rates than heretofore. Even in the absence of
 two-body relaxation, decay of binaries can persist as a
 result of repeated ejection of stars returning to the
 nucleus on eccentric orbits. We show that this recycling of
 stars leads to a gradual, approximately logarithmic
 dependence of the binary binding energy on time. We derive
 an expression for the loss cone refilling induced by the
 Brownian motion of a black hole binary. We also show that
 numerical N-body experiments are not well suited to probe
 these mechanisms over long times as a result of spurious
 relaxation.},

  Abstract                 = {The final merger of a pair of massive black holes in a
 galactic nucleus is compelled by gravitational radiation.
 Gravitational waves from the mergers of black holes of
 masses 105-107(1+z)-1 Msolar at redshifts of 1-20 will be
 readily detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space
 Antenna, but an electromagnetic afterglow would be helpful
 in pinpointing the source and its redshift. Long before the
 merger, the binary ``hollows out'' any surrounding gas and
 shrinks slowly compared to the viscous timescale of a
 circumbinary disk. The inner gas disk is truncated at the
 radius where gravitational torque from the binary balances
 the viscous torque, and accretion onto the black holes is
 diminished. Initially, the inner truncation radius is able
 to follow the shrinking binary inward. But eventually the
 gravitational radiation timescale becomes shorter than the
 viscous timescale in the disk, leading to a merged black
 hole surrounded by a hollow disk of gas. We show that the
 subsequent viscous evolution of the hollow, radiation
 pressure-dominated disk will create an \~{}1043.5(M/106
 Msolar) ergs s-1 X-ray source on a timescale
 \~{}7(1+z)(M/106 Msolar)1.32 yr. This justifies follow-up
 monitoring of gravitational wave events with
 next-generation X-ray observatories. Analysis of the
 detailed light curve of these afterglows will yield new
 insights into the subtle physics of accretion onto massive
 black holes.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the dynamic efficiency of conversion of
 kinetic-to-thermal/magnetic energy of internal shocks in
 relativistic magnetized outflows. We model internal shocks
 as being caused by collisions of shells of plasma with the
 same energy flux and a non-zero relative velocity. The
 contact surface, where the interaction between the shells
 takes place, can break up either into two oppositely moving
 shocks (in the frame where the contact surface is at rest),
 or into a reverse shock and a forward rarefaction. We find
 that for moderately magnetized shocks (magnetization sigma
 ~= 0.1), the dynamic efficiency in a single two-shell
 interaction can be as large as 40 per cent. Thus, the
 dynamic efficiency of moderately magnetized shocks is
 larger than in the corresponding unmagnetized two-shell
 interaction. If the slower shell propagates with a
 sufficiently large velocity, the efficiency is only weakly
 dependent on its Lorentz factor. Consequently, the dynamic
 efficiency of shell interactions in the magnetized flow of
 blazars and gamma-ray bursts is effectively the same. These
 results are quantitatively rather independent on the
 equation of state of the plasma. The radiative efficiency
 of the process is expected to be a fraction fr < 1 of the
 estimated dynamic one, the exact value of fr depending on
 the particularities of the emission processes which radiate
 away the thermal or magnetic energy of the shocked
 states.},

 and emission of radio components in relativistic jets. We
 compute jet models by means of a relativistic hydrodynamics
 code. We have developed an algorithm (SPEV) for the
 transport of a population of nonthermal electrons including
 radiative losses. For large values of the ratio of gas
 pressure to magnetic field energy density, alphaB ~ 6 Ã—
 104, quiescent jet models show substantial spectral
 evolution, with observational consequences only above radio
 frequencies. Larger values of the magnetic field (alphaB ~
 6 Ã— 102), such that synchrotron losses are moderately
 important at radio frequencies, present a larger ratio of
 shocked-to-unshocked regions brightness than the models
 without radiative losses, despite the fact that they
 correspond to the same underlying hydrodynamic structure.
 We also show that jets with a positive photon spectral
 index result if the lower limit gammamin of the nonthermal
 particle energy distribution is large enough. A temporary
 increase of the Lorentz factor at the jet inlet produces a
 traveling perturbation that appears in the synthetic maps
 as a superluminal component. We show that trailing
 components can be originated not only in pressure matched
 jets, but also in overpressured ones, where the existence
 of recollimation shocks does not allow for a direct
 identification of such features as Kelvin-Helmholtz modes,
 and its observational imprint depends on the observing
 frequency. If the magnetic field is large (alphaB ~ 6 Ã—
 102), the spectral index in the rarefaction trailing the
 traveling perturbation does not change much with respect to
 the same model without any hydrodynamic perturbation. If
 the synchrotron losses are considered the spectral index
 displays a smaller value than in the corresponding region
 of the quiescent jet model.},

  Abstract                 = {The afterglow emission that follows gamma-ray bursts
 (GRBs) contains valuable information about the circumburst
 medium and, therefore, about the GRB progenitor.
 Theoretical studies of GRB blast waves, however, are often
 limited to simple density profiles for the external medium
 (mostly constant density and power-law R-k ones). We argue
 that a large fraction of long-duration GRBs should take
 place in massive stellar clusters where the circumburst
 medium is much more complicated. As a case study, we
 simulate the propagation of a GRB blast wave in a medium
 shaped by the collision of the winds of O and Wolf-Rayet
 stars, the typical distance of which is dËœ 0.1-1 pc.
 Assuming a spherical blast wave, the afterglow light curve
 shows a flattening followed by a shallow break on a
 time-scale from hours up to a week after the burst, which
 is a result of the propagation of the blast wave through
 the shocked wind region. If the blast wave is collimated,
 the jet break may, in some cases, become very pronounced
 with the post-break decline of the light curve as steep as
 t-5. Inverse Compton scattering of ultraviolet photons from
 the nearby star off energetic electrons in the blast wave
 leads to a bright ËœGeV afterglow flare that may be
 detectable by Fermi.},

  Abstract                 = {We model the non-thermal transient Swift J1644+57 as
 resulting from a relativistic jet powered by the accretion
 of a tidally disrupted star on to a supermassive black
 hole. Accompanying synchrotron radio emission is produced
 by the shock interaction between the jet and the dense
 circumnuclear medium, similar to a gamma-ray burst
 afterglow. An open mystery, however, is the origin of the
 late-time radio re-brightening, which occurred well after
 the peak of the jetted X-ray emission. Here, we
 systematically explore several proposed explanations for
 this behaviour by means of multidimensional hydrodynamic
 simulations coupled to a self-consistent radiative transfer
 calculation of the synchrotron emission. Our main
 conclusion is that the radio afterglow of Swift J1644+57 is
 not naturally explained by a jet with a one-dimensional
 top-hat angular structure. However, a more complex angular
 structure comprised of an ultrarelativistic core (Lorentz
 factor Gamma Ëœ 10) surrounded by a slower (Gamma Ëœ 2)
 sheath provides a reasonable fit to the data. Such a
 geometry could result from the radial structure of the
 super-Eddington accretion flow or as the result of jet
 precession. The total kinetic energy of the ejecta that we
 infer of Ëœ few 1053 erg requires a highly efficient jet
 launching mechanism. Our jet model providing the best fit
 to the light curve of the on-axis event Swift J1644+57 is
 used to predict the radio light curves for off-axis viewing
 angles. Implications for the presence of relativistic jets
 from tidal disruption events (TDEs) detected via their
 thermal disc emission, as well as the prospects for
 detecting orphan TDE afterglows with upcoming wide-field
 radio surveys and resolving the jet structure with long
 baseline interferometry, are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {If the stellar population of the bulge contains black
 holes formed in the final core collapse of ordinary stars
 with M>~30 Msolar, then about 25,000 stellar mass black
 holes should have migrated by dynamical friction into the
 central parsec of the Milky Way, forming a black hole
 cluster around the central supermassive black hole. These
 black holes can be captured by the central black hole when
 they randomly reach a highly eccentric orbit due to
 relaxation, either by direct capture (when their Newtonian
 peribothron is less than 4 Schwarzschild radii) or after
 losing orbital energy through gravitational waves. The
 overall depletion timescale is ~30 Gyr, so most of the
 25,000 black holes remain in the central cluster today. The
 presence of this black hole cluster would have several
 observable consequences. First, the low-mass, old stellar
 population should have been expelled from the region
 occupied by the black hole cluster as a result of
 relaxation, implying a core in the profile of solar-mass
 red giants with a radius of ~2 pc (i.e., 1'). The observed
 central density cusp (which has a core radius of only a few
 arcseconds) should be composed primarily of young (<~1 Gyr)
 stars. Second, flares from stars being captured by
 supermassive black holes in other galaxies should be rarer
 than usually expected because the older stars will have
 been expelled from the central regions by the black hole
 clusters of those galaxies. Third, the young (<~2 Gyr)
 stars found at distances ~3-10 pc from the Galactic center
 should be preferentially on highly eccentric orbits.
 Fourth, if future high-resolution K-band images reveal
 sources microlensed by the Milky Way's central black hole,
 then the cluster black holes could give rise to secondary
 (``planet-like'') perturbations on the main event.},

  abstract      = {While once rare, observations of stars being tidally disrupted by supermassive black holes are quickly becoming commonplace. To continue to learn from these events, it is necessary to robustly and systematically compare our growing number of observations with theory. We present a tidal disruption module for the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients (MOSFiT) and the results from fitting 14 tidal disruption events (TDEs). Our model uses FLASH simulations of TDEs to generate bolometric luminosities and passes these luminosities through viscosity and reprocessing transformation functions to create multiwavelength light curves. It then uses an MCMC fitting routine to compare these theoretical light curves with observations. We find that none of the events show evidence for viscous delays exceeding a few days, supporting the theory that our current observing strategies in the optical/UV are missing a significant number of viscously delayed flares. We find that the events have black hole masses of 106-108 M ? and that the masses we predict are as reliable as those based on bulk galaxy properties. We also find that there is a preference for stars with mass <1 M ?, as expected when low-mass stars greatly outnumber high-mass stars.},

 been directly measured with VLBI over a period of a few
 years. These measurements also allow the distance from the

 percent. The status of the search for other maser/black

  Abstract                 = {We report the discovery of 3.76 s pulsations from a new
 burst source near Sgr A* observed by the NuSTAR
 observatory. The strong signal from SGR J1745-29 presents a
 complex pulse profile modulated with pulsed fraction 27%
 $\pm$ 3% in the 3-10 keV band. Two observations spaced nine
 days apart yield a spin-down rate of \dot{P} =(6.5 $\pm$
 1.4) Ã— 10-12. This implies a magnetic field B = 1.6 Ã—
 1014 G, spin-down power \dot{E} =5 Ã— 1033 erg s-1, and
 characteristic age P/2\dot{P} =9 Ã— 103 yr for the rotating
 dipole model. However, the current \dot{P} may be erratic,
 especially during outburst. The flux and modulation
 remained steady during the observations and the 3-79 keV
 spectrum is well fitted by a combined blackbody plus
 power-law model with temperature kT BB = 0.96 $\pm$ 0.02
 keV and photon index Gamma = 1.5 $\pm$ 0.4. The neutral
 hydrogen column density (N H ~ 1.4 Ã— 1023 cm-2) measured
 by NuSTAR and Swift suggests that SGR J1745-29 is located
 at or near the Galactic center. The lack of an X-ray
 counterpart in the published Chandra survey catalog sets a
 quiescent 2-8 keV luminosity limit of Lx <~ 1032 erg s-1.
 The bursting, timing, and spectral properties indicate a
 transient magnetar undergoing an outburst with 2-79 keV
 luminosity up to 3.5 Ã— 1035 erg s-1 for a distance of 8
 kpc. SGR J1745-29 joins a growing subclass of transient
 magnetars, indicating that many magnetars in quiescence
 remain undetected in the X-ray band or have been detected
 as high-B radio pulsars. The peculiar location of SGR
 J1745-29 has important implications for the formation and
 dynamics of neutron stars in the Galactic center region.},

 nucleus are outlined, and the degree of the concentration
 of massive stellar remnants toward the nucleus is assessed.
 Within 10-100 parsecs of a galactic nucleus, star formation
 is strongly affected by the physical extremes of the
 nuclear region: strong tidal forces, strongly enhanced
 cloud turbulence and gas heating, and relatively large
 magnetic fields. Black hole remnants of massive stars will
 inevitably migrate in the central stellar core of a galaxy
 and be concentrated there. The radius from which they will
 sink into the core in the galaxy's lifetime depends on the
 central mass concentration; for the Milky Way, it is about
 4 pc. Close gravitational interactions of stellar remnants
 with red giants in the central stellar core of the Galaxy
 occur with sufficient frequency to be important for the
 evolution of both. The stellar core of the Galaxy is
 currently bereft of gas, except for the winds emanating
 from the luminous stellar objects located there.},

  Abstract                 = {Our current understanding of the stellar initial mass
 function and massive star evolution suggests that young
 globular clusters (GCs) may have formed hundreds to
 thousands of stellar-mass black holes (BHs), the remnants
 of stars with initial masses from ~20-100 M &sun;. Birth
 kicks from supernova explosions may eject some BHs from
 their birth clusters, but most should be retained. Using a
 Monte Carlo method we investigate the long-term dynamical
 evolution of GCs containing large numbers of stellar BHs.
 We describe numerical results for 42 models, covering a
 broad range of realistic initial conditions, including up
 to 1.6 Ã— 106 stars. In almost all models we find that
 significant numbers of BHs (up to ~103) are retained all
 the way to the present. This is in contrast to previous
 theoretical expectations that most BHs should be ejected
 dynamically within a few gigayears The main reason for this
 difference is that core collapse driven by BHs (through the
 Spitzer "mass segregation instability") is easily reverted
 through three-body processes, and involves only a small
 number of the most massive BHs, while lower-mass BHs remain
 well-mixed with ordinary stars far from the central cusp.
 Thus the rapid segregation of stellar BHs does not lead to
 a long-term physical separation of most BHs into a
 dynamically decoupled inner core, as often assumed
 previously. Combined with the recent detections of several
 BH X-ray binary candidates in Galactic GCs, our results
 suggest that stellar BHs could still be present in large
 numbers in many GCs today, and that they may play a
 significant role in shaping the long-term dynamical
 evolution and the present-day dynamical structure of many
 clusters.},

  Abstract                 = {Globular clusters should be born with significant numbers of stellar-mass black holes (BHs). It has been thought for two decades that very few of these BHs could be retained through the cluster lifetime. With masses ~10 M ?, BHs are ~20 times more massive than an average cluster star. They segregate into the cluster core, where they may eventually decouple from the remainder of the cluster. The small-N core then evaporates on a short timescale. This is the so-called Spitzer instability. Here we present the results of a full dynamical simulation of a globular cluster containing many stellar-mass BHs with a realistic mass spectrum. Our Monte Carlo simulation code includes detailed treatments of all relevant stellar evolution and dynamical processes. Our main finding is that old globular clusters could still contain many BHs at present. In our simulation, we find no evidence for the Spitzer instability. Instead, most of the BHs remain well mixed with the rest of the cluster, with only the innermost few tens of BHs segregating significantly. Over the 12 Gyr evolution, fewer than half of the BHs are dynamically ejected through strong binary interactions in the cluster core. The presence of BHs leads to long-term heating of the cluster, ultimately producing a core radius on the high end of the distribution for Milky Way globular clusters (and those of other galaxies). A crude extrapolation from our model suggests that the BH-BH merger rate from globular clusters could be comparable to the rate in the field.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new statistical method to determine the
 relationship between the stellar masses of galaxies and the
 masses of their host dark matter haloes over the entire
 cosmic history from z Ëœ 4 to the present. This multi-epoch
 abundance matching (MEAM) model self-consistently takes
 into account that satellite galaxies first become
 satellites at times earlier than they are observed. We
 employ a redshift-dependent parametrization of the
 stellar-to-halo-mass relation to populate haloes and
 subhaloes in the Millennium simulations with galaxies,
 requiring that the observed stellar mass functions at
 several redshifts are reproduced simultaneously. We show
 that physically meaningful growth of massive galaxies is
 consistent with these data only if observational mass
 errors are taken into account. Using merger trees extracted
 from the dark matter simulations in combination with MEAM,
 we predict the average assembly histories of galaxies,
 separating into star formation within the galaxies (in
 situ) and accretion of stars (ex situ). Our main results
 are the peak star formation efficiency decreases with
 redshift from 23 per cent at z = 0 to 9 per cent at z =4
 while the corresponding halo mass increases from 1011.8 to
 1012.5 M&sun;. The star formation rate of central galaxies
 peaks at a redshift which depends on halo mass; for massive
 haloes this peak is at early cosmic times while for
 low-mass galaxies the peak has not been reached yet. In
 haloes similar to that of the Milky Way about half of the
 central stellar mass is assembled after z = 0.7. In
 low-mass haloes, the accretion of satellites contributes
 little to the assembly of their central galaxies, while in
 massive haloes more than half of the central stellar mass
 is formed ex situ with significant accretion of satellites
 at z < 2. We find that our method implies a cosmic star
 formation history and an evolution of specific star
 formation rates which are consistent with those inferred
 directly. We present convenient fitting functions for
 stellar masses, star formation rates and accretion rates as
 functions of halo mass and redshift.},

 shallow Chandra survey of the inner 2degÃ—0.8d of the
 Galaxy and in two deeper observations of the Radio Arches
 and Sgr B2. The catalog contains 1352 objects that are
 highly absorbed (NH>~4Ã—1022 cm-2) and are therefore likely
 to lie near the Galactic center (D~8 kpc), and 549 less
 absorbed sources that lie within <~6 kpc of Earth. On the
 basis of the inferred luminosities of the X-ray sources and
 the expected numbers of various classes of objects, we
 suggest that the sources with LX<~1033 ergs s-1 that
 comprise ~90% of the catalog are cataclysmic variables and
 that the ~100 brighter objects are accreting neutron stars
 and black holes, young isolated pulsars, and Wolf-Rayet and
 O (WR/O) stars in colliding-wind binaries. We find that the
 spatial distribution of X-ray sources matches that of the
 old stellar population observed in the infrared, which
 supports our suggestion that most of the X-ray sources are
 old cataclysmic variables. However, we find that there is
 an apparent excess of ~10 bright sources in the Radio
 Arches region. That region is already known to be the site
 of recent star formation, so we suggest that the bright
 sources in this region are young high-mass X-ray binaries,
 pulsars, or WR/O star binaries. We briefly discuss some
 astrophysical questions that this catalog can be used to
 address.},

  Abstract                 = {During 5 years of Chandra observations, we have identified
 seven X-ray transients located within 23 pc of Sgr A*.
 These sources each vary in luminosity by more than a factor
 of 10 and have peak X-ray luminosities greater than 5Ã—1033
 ergs s-1, which strongly suggests that they are accreting
 black holes or neutron stars. The peak luminosities of the
 transients are intermediate between those typically
 considered outburst and quiescence for X-ray binaries.
 Remarkably, four of these transients lie within only 1 pc
 of Sgr A*. This implies that, compared to the numbers of
 similar systems located between 1 and 23 pc, transients are
 overabundant by a factor of >~20 per unit stellar mass
 within 1 pc of Sgr A*. It is likely that the excess
 transient X-ray sources are low-mass X-ray binaries that
 were produced, as in the cores of globular clusters, by
 three-body interactions between binary star systems and
 either black holes or neutron stars that have been
 concentrated in the central parsec through dynamical
 friction. Alternatively, they could be high-mass X-ray
 binaries that formed among the young stars that are present
 in the central parsec.},

  Abstract                 = {We employ hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the
 underlying mechanism responsible for the low levels of gas
 and dust in globular clusters. Our models examine the
 competing effects of mass supply from the evolved stellar
 population and energy injection from the main sequence
 stellar members for globular clusters 47 Tucanae, M15, NGC
 6440, and NGC 6752. Disregarding all other gas evacuation
 processes, we find that the energy output from the main
 sequence stellar population alone is capable of effectively
 clearing the evolved stellar ejecta and producing
 intracluster gas densities consistent with current
 observational constraints. This result distinguishes a
 viable ubiquitous gas and dust evacuation mechanism for
 globular clusters. In addition, we extend our analysis to
 probe the efficiency of pulsar wind feedback in globular
 clusters. The detection of intracluster ionized gas in
 cluster 47 Tucanae allows us to place particularly strict
 limits on pulsar wind thermalization efficiency, which must
 be extremely low in the cluster's core in order to be in
 accordance with the observed density constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {In the standard forward shock model for gamma-ray burst
 (GRB) afterglow, the observed afterglow emission is
 synchrotron radiation from a quasi-spherical, adiabatic,
 self-similar, relativistic blast wave, that propagates into
 the external medium. This model predicts a smooth light
 curve where the flux scales as a power law in time, and may
 at most smoothly transition to a different power law.
 However, some GRB afterglow light curves show significant
 variability, which often includes episodes of
 rebrightening. Such temporal variability had been
 attributed in several cases to a large enhancement in the
 external density, or a density `bump', that is encountered
 by the self-similar adiabatic blast wave. Here we examine
 the effect of a sharp increase in the external density on
 the afterglow light curve in this scenario by considering,
 for the first time, a full treatment of both the
 hydrodynamic evolution and the radiation. To this end we
 develop a semi-analytic model for the light curve and carry
 out numerical simulations using a one-dimensional
 hydrodynamic code together with a synchrotron radiation
 code. Two spherically symmetric cases are explored in
 detail - a density jump in a uniform external medium (which
 is used to constrain the effect of a density clump) and a
 wind termination shock. We find that even a very sharp
 (modelled as a step function) and large (by a factor of a
 >> 1) increase in the external density does not produce
 sharp features in the light curve, and cannot account for
 significant temporal variability in GRB afterglows in the
 forward shock model. For a wind termination shock, the
 light curve smoothly transitions between the asymptotic
 power laws over about one decade in time, and there is no
 rebrightening in the optical or X-rays that could serve as
 a clear observational signature. For a sharp jump in a
 uniform density profile, we find that the maximal deviation
 Deltaalphamax of the temporal decay index alpha from its
 asymptotic value (at early and late times) is bounded (e.g,
 Deltaalphamax < 0.4 for a = 10); Deltaalphamax slowly
 increases with a, converging to Deltaalphamax ~ 1 at very
 large a values. Therefore, no optical rebrightening is
 expected in this case as well. In the X-rays, while the
 asymptotic flux is unaffected by the density jump, the
 fluctuations in alpha are found to be comparable to those
 in the optical. Finally, we discuss the implications of our
 results for the origin of the observed fluctuations in
 several GRB afterglows.},

  Abstract                 = {Mergers of neutron-star/neutron-star binaries are strong
 sources of gravitational waves. They can also launch
 subrelativistic and mildly relativistic outflows and are
 often assumed to be the sources of short gamma-ray bursts.
 An electromagnetic signature that persisted for weeks to
 months after the event would strengthen any future claim of
 a detection of gravitational waves. Here we present results
 of calculations showing that the interaction of mildly
 relativistic outflows with the surrounding medium produces
 radio flares with peak emission at 1.4 gigahertz that
 persist at detectable (submillijansky) levels for weeks,
 out to a redshift of 0.1. Slower subrelativistic outflows
 produce flares detectable for years at 150 megahertz, as
 well as at 1.4 gigahertz, from slightly shorter distances.
 The radio transient RT 19870422 (ref. 11) has the
 properties predicted by our model, and its most probable
 origin is the merger of a compact neutron-star/neutron-star
 binary. The lack of radio detections usually associated
 with short gamma-ray bursts does not constrain the radio
 transients that we discuss here (from mildly relativistic
 and subrelativistic outflows) because short gamma-ray burst
 redshifts are typically >0.1 and the appropriate timescales
 (longer than weeks) have not been sampled.},

  Abstract                 = {We present general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of super-Eddington accretion on a 10 M? black hole. We consider a range of mass accretion rates, black hole spins and magnetic field configurations. We compute the spectra and images of the models as a function of viewing angle and compare them with the observed properties of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). The models easily produce apparent luminosities in excess of 1040 erg s-1 for pole-on observers. However, the angle-integrated radiative luminosities rarely exceed 2.5 × 1039 erg s-1 even for mass accretion rates of tens of Eddington. The systems are thus radiatively inefficient, though they are energetically efficient when the energy output in winds and jets is also counted. The simulated models reproduce the main empirical types of spectra - disc-like, supersoft, soft, hard - observed in ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). The magnetic field configuration, whether 'standard and normal evolution' (SANE) or 'magnetically arrested disc' (MAD), has a strong effect on the results. In SANE models, the X-ray spectral hardness is almost independent of accretion rate, but decreases steeply with increasing inclination. MAD models with non-spinning black holes produce significantly softer spectra at higher values of \dot{M}, even at low inclinations. MAD models with rapidly spinning black holes are unique. They are radiatively efficient (efficiency factor ?10-20 per cent), superefficient when the mechanical energy output is also included (70 per cent) and produce hard blazar-like spectra. In all models, the emission shows strong geometrical beaming, which disagrees with the more isotropic illumination favoured by observations of ULX bubbles.},

  Abstract                 = {A large fraction of ~100 km class low-inclination objects in the classical Kuiper Belt (KB) are binaries with comparable masses and a wide separation of components. A favored model for their formation is that they were captured during the coagulation growth of bodies in the early KB. However, recent studies have suggested that large, gsim100 km objects can rapidly form in the protoplanetary disks when swarms of locally concentrated solids collapse under their own gravity. Here, we examine the possibility that KB binaries formed during gravitational collapse when the excess of angular momentum prevented the agglomeration of available mass into a solitary object. We find that this new mechanism provides a robust path toward the formation of KB binaries with observed properties, and can explain wide systems such as 2001 QW322 and multiples such as (47171) 1999 TC36. Notably, the gravitational collapse is capable of producing ~100% binary fraction for a wide range of the swarm's initial angular momentum values. The binary components have similar masses (~80% have a secondary-over-primary radius ratio >0.7) and their separation ranges from ~1000 to ~100,000 km. The binary orbits have eccentricities from e = 0 to ~1, with the majority having e < 0.6. The binary orbit inclinations with respect to the initial angular momentum of the swarm range from i = 0 to ~90°, with most cases having i < 50°. The total binary mass represents a characteristic fraction of the collapsing swarm's total initial mass, M tot, suggesting M tot equivalent to that of a radius ~100-250 km compact object. Our binary formation mechanism also implies that the primary and secondary components in each binary pair should have identical bulk composition, which is consistent with the current photometric data. We discuss the applicability of our results to the Pluto-Charon, Orcus-Vanth, (617) Patroclus-Menoetius, and (90) Antiope binary systems.},

 situation occurs in galaxy merger events involving
 supermassive black holes, and in the formation of
 stellar--mass binaries in star clusters. We work out the
 gravitational torque between the binary and disc, and show
 that their angular momenta J\_b, J\_d stably counteralign
 if their initial orientation is sufficiently retrograde,
 specifically if the angle theta between them obeys
 cos(theta) < -J\_d/2J\_b, on a time short compared with the
 mass gain time of the central accretor(s). The magnitude
 J\_b remains unchanged in this process. Counteralignment
 can promote the rapid merger of supermassive black hole
 binaries, and possibly the formation of coplanar but
 retrograde planets around stars in binary systems.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate whether a circumbinary gas disc can
 coalesce a supermassive black hole binary system in the
 centre of a galaxy. This is known to be problematic for a
 prograde disc. We show that in contrast, interaction with a
 retrograde circumbinary disc is considerably more effective
 in shrinking the binary because there are no orbital
 resonances. The binary directly absorbs negative angular
 momentum from the circumbinary disc by capturing gas into a
 disc around the secondary black hole, or discs around both
 holes if the binary mass ratio is close to unity. In many
 cases the binary orbit becomes eccentric, shortening the
 pericentre distance as the eccentricity grows. In all cases
 the binary coalesces once it has absorbed the angular
 momentum of a gas mass comparable to that of the secondary
 black hole. Importantly, this conclusion is unaffected even
 if the gas inflow rate through the disc is formally
 super-Eddington for either hole. The coalescence time-scale
 is therefore always ?, where M2 is the secondary black hole
 mass and ? the inflow rate through the circumbinary disc.},

  Abstract                 = {Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) are expected to segregate
 and form a steep density cusp around supermassive black
 holes (SMBHs) in galactic nuclei. We follow the evolution
 of a multimass system of BHs and stars by numerically
 integrating the Fokker-Planck energy diffusion equations
 for a variety of BH mass distributions. We find that the
 BHs `self-segregate', and that the rarest, most massive BHs
 dominate the scattering rate closest to the SMBH
 (<~10-1pc). BH-BH binaries form out of gravitational wave
 emission during BH encounters. We find that the expected
 rate of BH coalescence events detectable by Advanced LIGO
 is ~1-102yr-1, depending on the initial mass function of
 stars in galactic nuclei and the mass of the most massive
 BHs. We find that the actual merger rate is likely ~10
 times larger than this due to the intrinsic scatter of
 stellar densities in many different galaxies. The BH
 binaries that form this way in galactic nuclei have
 significant eccentricities as they enter the LIGO band (90
 per cent with e > 0.9), and are therefore distinguishable
 from other binaries, which circularize before becoming
 detectable. We also show that eccentric mergers can be
 detected to larger distances and greater BH masses than
 circular mergers, up to ~700Msolar. Future ground-based
 gravitational wave observatories will be able to constrain
 both the mass function of BHs and stars in galactic
 nuclei.},

 (SNRs) is very complex, in terms of both their geometrical
 shape and their spectral properties, dominated by
 non-thermal synchrotron and inverse-Compton scattering. We
 propose a post-processing method to analyse the broad-band
 emission of \{SNRs\} based on three-dimensional
 hydrodynamical simulations. From the hydrodynamical data,
 we estimate the distribution of non-thermal electrons
 accelerated at the shock wave and follow the subsequent
 evolution as they lose or gain energy by adiabatic
 expansion or compression and emit energy by radiation. As a
 first test case, we use a simulation of a bipolar supernova
 expanding into a cloudy medium. We find that our method
 qualitatively reproduces the main observational features of
 typical \{SNRs\} and produces fluxes that agree with
 observations to within a factor of a few allowing for
 further use in more extended sets of models. },

  Abstract                 = {The quasi-steady structure of supercritical accretion
 flows around a black hole is studied based on
 two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic (2D-RHD)
 simulations. The supercritical flow is composed of two
 parts: the disk region and the outflow regions above and
 below the disk. Within the disk region the circular motion
 and the patchy density structure are observed, which is
 caused by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and probably by
 convection. The mass accretion rate decreases inward,
 roughly in proportion to the radius, and the remaining part
 of the disk material leaves the disk to form the outflow
 because of the strong radiation pressure force. We confirm
 that photon trapping plays an important role within the
 disk. Thus, matter can fall onto the black hole at a rate
 exceeding the Eddington rate. The emission is highly
 anisotropic and moderately collimated so that the apparent
 luminosity can exceed the Eddington luminosity by a factor
 of a few in the face-on view. The mass accretion rate onto
 the black hole increases with the absorption opacity
 (metallicity) of the accreting matter. This implies that
 the black hole tends to grow faster in metal-rich regions,
 such as in starburst galaxies or star-forming regions.},

  Abstract                 = {The deposition of mechanical feedback from a supermassive
 black hole (SMBH) in an active galactic nucleus into the
 surrounding galaxy occurs via broad-line winds which must
 carry mass and radial momentum as well as energy. The
 effect can be summarized by the dimensionless parameter eta
 ={\dot{M}_outf}/{\dot{M}_acc}= {2 Îµ_wc^2}/{v_w^2} where
 epsilonw (â‰¡ \dot{E}_w/(\dot{M}_accc^2)) is the efficiency
 with which accreted matter is turned into wind energy in
 the disk surrounding the central SMBH. The outflowing mass
 and momentum are proportional to eta, and many prior
 treatments have essentially assumed that eta = 0. We
 perform one- and two-dimensional simulations and find that
 the growth of the central SMBH is very sensitive to the
 inclusion of the mass and momentum driving but is
 insensitive to the assumed mechanical efficiency. For
 example in representative calculations, the omission of
 momentum and mass feedback leads to a hundred-fold increase
 in the mass of the SMBH to over 1010 M sun. When allowance
 is made for momentum driving, the final SMBH mass is much
 lower and the wind efficiencies that lead to the most
 observationally acceptable results are relatively low with
 epsilonw <~ 10-4.},

The analytical calculations are restricted to a relativistic remnant and, in the case of collimated ejecta, to the phase where there is an insignificant lateral expansion. Results are given for both a homogeneous external medium and a wind ejected by the GRB progenitor. We compare the afterglow emission at different observing frequencies, for each type of external medium. It is found that observations at submillimeter frequencies during the first day provide the best way of discriminating between the two models. By taking into account the effect of inverse Compton (IC) scatterings on the electron cooling, a new possible time dependence of the cooling break is identified. The signature of the upscattering losses could be seen in the optical synchrotron emission from a GRB remnant interacting with a preejected wind, as a temporary mild flattening of the afterglow decay. The upscattered radiation itself should be detected in the soft X-ray emission from GRB remnants running into denser external media, starting a few hours after the main event.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a scenario for launching relativistic jets from
 rotating black holes, in which small-scale magnetic flux
 loops, sustained by disc turbulence, are forced to inflate
 and open by differential rotation between the black hole
 and the accretion flow. This mechanism does not require a
 large-scale net magnetic flux in the accreting plasma.
 Estimates suggest that the process could operate
 effectively in many systems, and particularly naturally and
 efficiently when the accretion flow is retrograde. We
 present the results of general-relativistic force-free
 electrodynamic simulations demonstrating the time evolution
 of the black hole's magnetosphere, the cyclic formation of
 jets, and the effect of magnetic reconnection. The jets are
 highly variable on time-scales Ëœ10-103rg/c, where rg is
 the black hole's gravitational radius. The reconnecting
 current sheets observed in the simulations may be
 responsible for the hard X-ray emission from accreting
 black holes.},

  Abstract                 = {Stochastic wave-particle acceleration may be responsible
 for producing suprathermal particles in many astrophysical
 situations. The process can be described as a diffusion
 process through the Fokker-Planck equation. If the
 acceleration region is homogeneous and the scattering mean
 free path is much smaller than both the energy change mean
 free path and the size of the acceleration region, then the
 Fokker-Planck equation reduces to a simple form involving
 only the time and energy variables. in an earlier paper
 (Park & Petrosian 1995, hereafter Paper 1), we studied the
 analytic properties of the Fokker-Planck equation and found
 analytic solutions for some simple cases. In this paper, we
 study the numerical methods which must be used to solve
 more general forms of the equation. Two classes of
 numerical methods are finite difference methods and Monte
 Carlo simulations. We examine six finite difference
 methods, three fully implicit and three semi-implicit, and
 a stochastic simulation method which uses the exact
 correspondence between the Fokker-Planck equation and the
 it5 stochastic differential equation. As discussed in Paper
 I, Fokker-Planck equations derived under the above
 approximations are singular, causing problems with boundary
 conditions and numerical overflow and underflow. We
 evaluate each method using three sample equations to test
 its stability, accuracy, efficiency, and robustness for
 both time-dependent and steady state solutions. We conclude
 that the most robust finite difference method is the fully
 implicit Chang-Cooper method, with minor extensions to
 account for the escape and injection terms. Other methods
 suffer from stability and accuracy problems when dealing
 with some Fokker-Planck equations. The stochastic
 simulation method, although simple to implement, is
 susceptible to Poisson noise when insufficient test
 particles are used and is computationally very expensive
 compared to the finite difference method.},

  Abstract                 = {We report the definite spectroscopic identification of
 ~=40 OB supergiants, giants, and main-sequence stars in the
 central parsec of the Galaxy. Detection of their absorption
 lines has become possible with the high spatial and
 spectral resolution and sensitivity of the adaptive optics
 integral field spectrometer SPIFFI/SINFONI on the ESO VLT.
 Several of these OB stars appear to be helium- and
 nitrogen-rich. Almost all of the ~=80 massive stars now
 known in the central parsec (central arcsecond excluded)
 reside in one of two somewhat thick (<h/R>~=0.14) rotating
 disks. These stellar disks have fairly sharp inner edges
 (R~=1'') and surface density profiles that scale as R-2. We
 do not detect any OB stars outside the central 0.5 pc. The
 majority of the stars in the clockwise system appear to be
 on almost circular orbits, whereas most of those in the
 ``counterclockwise'' disk appear to be on eccentric orbits.
 Based on its stellar surface density distribution and
 dynamics, we propose that IRS 13E is an extremely dense
 cluster (rhocore>~3Ã—108 Msolar pc-3) that has formed in
 the counterclockwise disk. The stellar contents of both
 systems are remarkably similar, indicating a common age of
 ~=6+/-2 Myr. The K-band luminosity function of the massive
 stars suggests a top-heavy mass function and limits the
 total stellar mass contained in both disks to ~=1.5Ã—104
 Msolar. Our data strongly favor in situ star formation from
 dense gas accretion disks for the two stellar disks. This
 conclusion is very clear for the clockwise disk and highly
 plausible for the counterclockwise system. Based on
 observations with the Very Large Telescope of the European
 Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile.},

  Abstract                 = {Stellar physics and evolution calculations enable a broad
 range of research in astrophysics. Modules for Experiments
 in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source,
 robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range
 of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A
 one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar,
 combines many of the numerical and physics modules for
 simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios
 ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including
 advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully
 coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously.
 It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep
 controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on
 OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state,
 opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data,
 and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is
 constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own
 explicitly defined public interface to facilitate
 independent development. Several detailed examples indicate
 the extensive verification and testing that is continuously
 performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities
 that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary
 tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant
 planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track
 of a 1 M sun star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a
 cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the
 evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core
 burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning
 asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of
 slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete
 evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the
 onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing
 Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion
 onto a neutron star. MESA can be downloaded from the
 project Web site (http://mesa.sourceforge.net/).},

 Astrophysics (MESA), and its one-dimensional stellar
 evolution module, MESA star. Improvements in MESA star's
 ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends
 its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that
 of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology
 enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions
 motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic
 pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a
 numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more
 easily implemented when many nuclei are present at
 non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which
 MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline
 mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M &sun; stars
 through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal
 pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We
 implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical
 abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star
 models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We
 introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes
 that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to
 core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of
 supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability
 progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which
 MESA star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and
 composition equations, and we show how this has improved
 the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core
 processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state,
 opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary
 conditions are also provided. We describe the MESA Software
 Development Kit that packages all the required components
 needed to form a unified, maintained, and well-validated
 build environment for MESA. We also highlight a few tools
 developed by the community for rapid visualization of MESA
 star results.},

MESA can now simultaneously evolve an interacting pair of differentially rotating stars undergoing transfer and loss of mass and angular momentum, greatly enhancing the prior ability to model binary evolution. New MESA capabilities in fully coupled calculation of nuclear networks with hundreds of isotopes now allow MESA to accurately simulate the advanced burning stages needed to construct supernova progenitor models. Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be treated with MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star lifecycle, from pre-main-sequence evolution to the onset of core collapse and nucleosynthesis from the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation instrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the instability strips for massive stars while also accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology data. We improve the treatment of mass accretion, giving more accurate and robust near-surface profiles. A new MESA capability to calculate weak reaction rates ?on-the-fly? from input nuclear data allows better simulation of accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the fate of some massive stars. We discuss the ongoing challenge of chemical diffusion in the strongly coupled plasma regime, and exhibit improvements in MESA that now allow for the simulation of radiative levitation of heavy elements in hot stars. We close by noting that the MESA software infrastructure provides bit-for-bit consistency for all results across all the supported platforms, a profound enabling capability for accelerating MESA's development.},

  Abstract                 = {Nuclear hard X-ray luminosities (L X,nuc) for a sample of
 112 early-type galaxies within a distance of 67 Mpc are
 used to investigate their relationship with the central
 galactic black hole mass M BH (coming from direct dynamical
 studies or the M BH-sigma relation), the inner galactic
 structure (using the parameters describing its cuspiness),
 the hot gas content, and the core radio luminosity. For
 this sample, L X,nuc ranges from 1038 to 1042 erg s-1, and
 the Eddington ratio L X,nuc/L Edd from 10-9 to 10-4, with
 the largest values belonging to four Seyfert galaxies.
 Together with a trend for L X,nuc to increase on average
 with the galactic luminosity LB and M BH, there is a wide
 variation of L X,nuc (and L X,nuc/L Edd), by up to 4 orders
 of magnitude, at any fixed LB > 6 Ã— 109 L B,sun or M BH >
 107 M sun. This large observed range should reflect a large
 variation of the mass accretion rate \dot{M}_BH, and
 possible reasons for this difference are searched for. On
 the circumnuclear scale, in a scenario where accretion is
 (quasi) steady, \dot{M}_BH at fixed LB (or M BH) could vary
 due to differences in the fuel production rate from stellar
 mass return linked to the inner galactic structure; a trend
 of L X,nuc with cuspiness is not observed, though, while a
 tendency for L X,nuc/L Edd to be larger in cuspier galaxies
 is present. In fact, \dot{M}_BH is predicted to vary with
 cuspiness by a factor exceeding a few only in hot gas-poor
 galaxies and for large differences in the core radius; for
 a subsample with these characteristics the expected effect
 seems to be present in the observed L X,nuc values. L X,nuc
 does not show a dependence on the age of the stellar
 population in the central galactic region, for ages >3 Gyr;
 less luminous nuclei, though, are found among the youngest
 galaxies or galaxies with a younger stellar component. On
 the global galactic scale, L X,nuc shows a trend with the
 total galactic hot gas cooling rate (L X,ISM): it is
 detected both in gas-poor and gas-rich galaxies, and on
 average increases with L X,ISM, but again with a large
 scatter. The observed lack of a tight relationship between
 L X,nuc and the circumnuclear and total gas content can be
 explained if accretion is regulated by factors overcoming
 the importance of fuel availability, as (1) the gas is
 heated by black hole feedback and \dot{M}_BH varies due to
 an activity cycle, and (2) the mass effectively accreted by
 the black hole can be largely reduced with respect to that
 entering the circumnuclear region, as in radiatively
 inefficient accretion with winds/outflows. Finally,
 differently from L X,nuc, the central 5 GHz VLA luminosity
 shows a clear trend with the inner galactic structure that
 is similar to that shown by the total soft X-ray emission;
 therefore, it is suggested that they could both be produced
 by the hot gas.},

  Abstract                 = {Supermassive black hole (BH) masses (MBH) are strongly correlated with galaxy stellar bulge masses (Mbulge), and there are several ideas to explain the origin of this relationship. This study isolates the role of galaxy mergers from considerations of other detailed physics to more clearly show how a linear BH-galaxy mass relation (MBH-Mgal) can naturally emerge, regardless of how primordial BHs were seeded inside galaxies, if the galaxy mass function declines with increasing mass. Under this circumstance, the MBH-Mgal relation is a passive attractor that eventually converges to a tight linear relation because of two basic statistical effects: a central-limit-like tendency for galaxy mergers, which is much stronger for major mergers than for minor mergers, and a convergence toward a linear relation that is due mainly to minor mergers. A curious consequence of this thought experiment is that if galaxy bulges are formed by major mergers, then merger statistics naturally show that MBH will correlate more strongly with bulge-dominated galaxies, because of stronger central-seeking tendencies, than with disk-dominated galaxies. Even if some other physics is ultimately responsible for causing a linear MBH-Mbulge relationship, this thought experiment shows that, counter to intuition, random merging of galaxies that harbor random BH masses tends to strengthen rather than weaken a preexisting, linear, correlation. This idea may be generalized to other gravitationally bound systems (dark matter halos, compact nuclear objects) that retain their physical identities after experiencing mergers.},

  Abstract                 = {We explore full/partial tidal disruption events (TDEs) of
 stars/planets by stellar compact objects (black holes (BHs)
 or neutron stars (NSs)), which we term micro-TDEs.
 Disruption of a star/planet with mass M * may lead to the
 formation of a debris disk around the BH/NS. Efficient
 accretion of a fraction ({f}{acc}=0.1 of the debris may
 then give rise to bright, energetic, long (103-104 s),
 X-ray/gamma-ray flares, with total energies of up to
 ({f}{acc}/0.1)Ã— {10}52 ({M}\star /0.6 {M}&sun; ) erg,
 possibly resembling ultra-long gamma-ray bursts
 (GRBs)/X-ray flashes (XRFs). The energy of such flares
 depends on the poorly constrained accretion processes.
 Significantly fainter flares might be produced if most of
 the disk mass is blown away through strong outflows. We
 suggest three dynamical origins for such disruptions. In
 the first, a star/planet is tidally disrupted following a
 close random encounter with a BH/NS in a dense cluster. We
 estimate the BH (NS) micro-TDE rates from this scenario to
 be a few Ã— {10}-6 (a few Ã— {10}-7) {{{yr}}}-1 per Milky
 Way galaxy. Another scenario involves the interaction of
 wide companions due to perturbations by stars in the field,
 likely producing comparable but lower rates. Finally, a
 third scenario involves a BH/NS that gains a natal velocity
 kick at birth, leading to a close encounter with a binary
 companion and the tidal disruption of that companion. Such
 events could be associated with a supernova, or even with a
 preceding GRB/XRF event, and would likely occur hours to
 days after the prompt explosion; the rates of such events
 could be larger than those obtained from the other
 scenarios, depending on the preceding complex binary
 stellar evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Context. High-mass microquasars consist of a massive star
 and a compact object, the latter producing jets that will
 interact with the stellar wind. The evolution of the jets,
 and ultimately their radiative outcome, could depend
 strongly on the inhomogeneity of the wind, which calls for
 a detailed study. Aims: The hydrodynamics of the
 interaction between a jet and a clumpy wind is studied,
 focusing on the global wind- and single clump-jet
 interplay. Methods: We have performed, using the code
 Ratpenat, three-dimensional numerical simulations of a
 clumpy wind interacting with a mildly relativistic jet, and
 of individual clumps penetrating into a jet. Results: For
 typical wind and jet velocities, filling factors of about
 â‰³0.1 are already enough for the wind to be considered as
 clumpy. An inhomogeneous wind makes the jet more unstable
 when crossing the system. Kinetic luminosities ~1037 erg/s
 allow the jet to reach the borders of a compact binary with
 an O star, as in the smooth wind case, although with a
 substantially higher degree of disruption. When able to
 enter into the jet, clumps are compressed and heated during
 a time of about their size divided by the sound speed in
 the shocked clump. Then, clumps quickly disrupt,
 mass-loading and slowing down the jet. Conclusions: We
 conclude that moderate wind clumpiness makes already a
 strong difference with the homogeneous wind case, enhancing
 jet disruption, mass-loading, bending, and likely energy
 dissipation in the form of emission. All this can have
 observational consequences at high-energies and also in the
 large-scale radio jets.},

 conservation laws of energy, momentum, and angular

 momentum of a system due to the radiation of gravitational
 waves is found. Two techniques, radiation reaction and flux
 across a large sphere, are used in these calculations and
 are shown to be in agreement over a time average. In the
 nonrelativistic limit, the energy and angular momentum
 radiation and angular distributions are expressed in terms
 of time derivatives of the quadrupole tensor Qij. These
 results are then applied to a bound system of two point
 masses moving in elliptical orbits. The secular decays of
 the semimajor axis and eccentricity are found as functions
 of time, and are integrated to specify the decay by
 gravitational radiation of such systems as functions of
 their initial conditions.},

 estimate that ~1000 radio pulsars may currently orbit Sgr

 most luminous of these pulsars may be detectable with
 current telescopes in periodicity searches at frequencies
 near 10 GHz, where the effects of interstellar scattering
 are alleviated. Long-term timing observations of such a
 pulsar would clearly reveal its Keplerian motion and
 possibly show the effects of relativistic gravity. We
 briefly discuss how pulsar timing can be used to study the
 dynamical and interstellar environment of the central black
 hole and speculate on the prospects for astrometric
 observations of an orbiting pulsar.},

  Abstract                 = {We present spatially resolved imaging and integral field
 spectroscopy data for 450 cool giant stars within 1 pc from
 Sgr A*. We use the prominent CO bandheads to derive
 effective temperatures of individual giants. Additionally
 we present the deepest spectroscopic observation of the
 Galactic center (GC) so far, probing the number of B9/A0
 main-sequence stars (2.2-2.8 M sun) in two deep fields.
 From spectrophotometry we construct a Hertzsprung-Russell
 diagram of the red giant population and fit the observed
 diagram with model populations to derive the star formation
 history of the nuclear cluster. We find (1) that the
 average nuclear star formation rate dropped from an initial
 maximum ~10 Gyr ago to a deep minimum 1-2 Gyr ago and
 increased again during the last few hundred Myrs, (2) that
 roughly 80% of the stellar mass formed more than 5 Gyr ago,
 and (3) that mass estimates within R ~ 1 pc from Sgr A*
 favor a dominant star formation mode with a "normal"
 Chabrier/Kroupa initial mass function for the majority of
 the past star formation in the GC. The bulk stellar mass
 seems to have formed under conditions significantly
 different from the young stellar disks, perhaps because at
 the time of the formation of the nuclear cluster the
 massive black hole and its sphere of influence were much
 smaller than today. Based on observations collected at the

  Abstract                 = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRB?s), short and intense pulses of low-energy ? rays, have fascinated astronomers and astrophysicists since their unexpected discovery in the late sixties. During the last decade, several space missions?BATSE (Burst and Transient Source Experiment) on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory, BeppoSAX and now HETE II (High-Energy Transient Explorer)?together with ground-based optical, infrared, and radio observatories have revolutionized our understanding of GRB?s, showing that they are cosmological, that they are accompanied by long-lasting afterglows, and that they are associated with core-collapse supernovae. At the same time a theoretical understanding has emerged in the form of the fireball internal-external shocks model. According to this model GRB?s are produced when the kinetic energy of an ultrarelativistic flow is dissipated in internal collisions. The afterglow arises when the flow is slowed down by shocks with the surrounding circumburst matter. This model has had numerous successful predictions, like the predictions of the afterglow itself, of jet breaks in the afterglow light curve, and of the optical flash that accompanies the GRB?s. This review focuses on the current theoretical understanding of the physical processes believed to take place in GRB?s.},

  Abstract                 = {A tidal disruption event (TDE) takes place when a star
 passes near enough to a massive black hole to be disrupted.
 About half the star's matter is given elliptical
 trajectories with large apocenter distances, the other half
 is unbound. To "circularize", i.e., to form an accretion
 flow, the bound matter must lose a significant amount of
 energy, with the actual amount depending on the
 characteristic scale of the flow measured in units of the
 black hole's gravitational radius ($\sim 10^{51}
 (R/1000R_g)^{-1}$~erg). Recent numerical simulations
 \citep{Shiokawa+2015} have revealed that the
 circularization scale is close to the scale of the
 most-bound initial orbits, $\sim 10^3 M_{BH,6.5}^{-2/3} R_g
 \sim 10^{15} M_{BH,6.5}^{1/3}$~cm from the black hole, and
 the corresponding circularization energy dissipation rate
 is $\sim 10^{44} M_{BH,6.5}^{-1/6}$~erg/s. We suggest that
 the energy liberated during circularization, rather then
 energy liberated by accretion onto the black hole, powers
 the observed optical TDE candidates. The observed rise
 times, luminosities, temperatures, emission radii, and line
 widths seen in these TDEs \citep[e.g.][]{Arcavi+2014} are
 all more readily explained in terms of heating associated
 with circularization than in terms of accretion.},

 $\,^{\circ}$ of the Galaxy is presented, including a total
 of about 1.5 Ms of EPIC-pn cleaned exposures in the central
 15 arcsec and about 200 ks outside. This compendium
 presents broad-band X-ray continuum maps, soft X-ray
 intensity maps, a decomposition into spectral components
 and a comparison of the X-ray maps with emission at other
 wavelengths. Newly discovered extended features, such as
 supernova remnants (SNRs), superbubbles and X-ray filaments
 are reported. We provide an atlas of extended features
 within $\pm$1$\,^{\circ}$ of Sgr A*. We discover the
 presence of a coherent X-ray-emitting region peaking around
 G0.1-0.1 and surrounded by the ring of cold,
 mid-IR-emitting material known from previous work as the
 `Radio Arc Bubble' and with the addition of the X-ray data
 now appears to be a candidate superbubble. Sgr A's bipolar
 lobes show sharp edges, suggesting that they could be the
 remnant, collimated by the circumnuclear disc, of an SN
 explosion that created the recently discovered magnetar,
 SGR J1745-2900. Soft X-ray features, most probably from
 SNRs, are observed to fill holes in the dust distribution,
 and to indicate a direct interaction between SN explosions
 and Galactic centre (GC) molecular clouds. We also discover
 warm plasma at high Galactic latitude, showing a sharp edge
 to its distribution that correlates with the location of
 known radio/mid-IR features such as the `GC Lobe'. These
 features might be associated with an inhomogeneous hot
 `atmosphere' over the GC, perhaps fed by continuous or
 episodic outflows of mass and energy from the GC region.},

  Abstract                 = {We have selected a sample of local E+A galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 for follow-up integral field spectroscopy with the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) on the Australian National University's (ANU) 2.3-m telescope. The sample was selected using the H? line in place of the [O II] ?3727 line as the indicator of ongoing star formation (or lack thereof). This allowed us to select a lower redshift sample of galaxies than available in the literature since the [O II] ?3727 falls off the blue end of the wavelength coverage in the SDSS for the very lowest redshift objects. This low-redshift selection means that the galaxies have a large angular to physical scale which allows us to resolve the central ?1 kpc region of the galaxies; the region where stellar population gradients are expected. Such observations have been difficult to make using other higher redshift samples because even at redshifts z? 0.1 the angular to physical scale is similar to the resolution provided by ground-based seeing. Our integral field spectroscopy has enabled us to make the first robust detections of Balmer line gradients in the centres of E+A galaxies. Six out of our sample of seven, and all the galaxies with regular morphologies, are observed to have compact and centrally concentrated Balmer line absorption. This is evidence for compact young cores and stellar population gradients which are predicted from models of mergers and tidal interactions which funnel gas into the galaxy core. Given the generally isolated nature of our sample, this argues for the galaxies being seen in the late stage of a merger where the progenitors have already coalesced.},

 mechanism of Fabian, Pringle, and Rees: when two unbound
 stars have a close encounter, they may become bound by the
 energy that each deposits into nonradial oscillations of
 the other. After dimensional scalings are removed, the
 process depends only on a single dimensionless parameter,
 and on the dimensionless envelope structure of the stars.
 General formulae are derived; for definiteness, we apply
 them to the specific case of stars with an n = 3 polytropic
 structure. Capture cross sections as a function of velocity
 and capture rates for an isothermal distribution are given
 for the case of equal-mass stars; other cases can easily be
 computed from the formulae given.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate a purely stellar dynamical solution to the
 Final Parsec Problem. Galactic nuclei resulting from major
 mergers are not spherical, but show some degree of
 triaxiality. With N-body simulations, we show that
 equal-mass massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) hosted by
 them will continuously interact with stars on centrophilic
 orbits and will thus inspiral---in much less than a Hubble
 time---down to separations at which gravitational-wave (GW)
 emission is strong enough to drive them to coalescence.
 Such coalescences will be important sources of GWs for
 future space-borne detectors such as the Laser
 Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Based on our results
 for equal-mass mergers, and given that the hardening rate
 of unequal-mass binaries is similar, we expect that LISA
 will see between \~{}10 and \~{} few Ã— 102 such events
 every year, depending on the particular massive black hole
 (MBH) seed model as obtained in recent studies of merger
 trees of galaxy and MBH co-evolution. Orbital
 eccentricities in the LISA band will be clearly

 uncertainties in accretion disk theory are the dissipation
 process (viscosity) and the emission process. It is noted
 that disk modeling is in some sense more an art than a
 science, and since a steady disk can be constructed for
 almost any combination of viscosity and radiation
 processes, the possibilities are almost endless.
 Conversely, it is likely that more can be learned about the
 properties of accretion disks in astrophysics by
 observation and subsequent modeling than by pure
 theorizing.},

We discuss the relevance of both types of outflows to the so-called AGN feedback problem. However, the AGN feedback should not be considered separately from the AGN physics. Therefore, we also discuss the issue whether the properties of the same outflows are consistent with the gas properties in broad- and narrow-line regions.},

 Galaxy is believed to be a 2.6Ã—106 Msolar black hole that
 accretes gas from the winds of nearby stars. We show that
 limits on the X-ray and infrared emission from the Galactic
 center provide an upper limit of ~8Ã—10-5 Msolar yr-1 on
 the mass accretion rate in Sgr A*. The advection-dominated
 accretion flow (ADAF) model favors a rate of <~10-5 Msolar
 yr-1. In comparison, the Bondi accretion rate onto Sgr A*,
 estimated using the observed spatial distribution of
 mass-losing stars and assuming noninteracting stellar
 winds, is ~3Ã—10-5 Msolar yr-1. Thus, there is rough
 agreement between the Bondi, the ADAF, and the
 X-ray-inferred accretion rates for Sgr A*. We discuss
 uncertainties in these estimates, emphasizing the
 importance of upcoming observations by the Chandra X-ray
 Observatory for tightening the X-ray-derived limits.},

 binary semimajor axis and eccentricity are derived from
 scattering experiments for the restricted three-body

 in simple models for galactic nuclei, starting soon after
 the black holes become bound and continuing until the
 evolution is dominated by the emission of gravitational
 radiation or until the ejected mass is too large for the
 galaxy to be considered fixed. The eccentricity growth is
 found to be unimportant unless the binary forms with a
 large eccentricity. The scattering results suggest that a
 binary with masses m\_1>=m\_2 should not be considered hard
 until its orbital velocity exceeds the background velocity
 dispersion by a factor that scales as (1+m\_1/m\_2)\^{}1/2.
 The results are compared with predictions from
 Chandrasekhar's dynamical-friction formula and with
 previous work on the capture and scattering of comets by
 planetary systems.},

  Abstract                 = {We demonstrate the existence of an enhanced rate of
 angular momentum relaxation in nearly Keplerian star
 clusters, such as those found in the centers of galactic
 nuclei containing massive black holes. The enhanced
 relaxation arises because the radial and azimuthal orbital
 frequencies in a Keplerian potential are equal, and hence
 may be termed resonant relaxation. We explore the dynamics
 of resonant relaxation using both numerical simulations and
 order-of-magnitude analytic calculations. We find that the
 resonant angular momentum relaxation time is shorter than
 the non-resonant relaxation time by of order M*/ M, where
 M* is the mass in stars and M is the mass of the central
 object. Resonance does not enhance the energy relaxation
 rate. We examine the effect of resonant relaxation on the
 rate of tidal disruption of stars by the central mass; we
 find that the flux of stars into the loss cone is enhanced
 when the loss cone is empty, but that the disruption rate
 averaged over the entire cluster is not strongly affected.
 We show that relativistic precession can disable resonant
 relaxation near the main-sequence loss cone for black hole
 masses comparable to those in galactic nuclei. Resonant
 dynamical friction leads to growth or decay of the
 eccentricity of the orbit of a massive body, depending on
 whether the distribution function of the stars is
 predominantly radial or tangential. The accelerated
 relaxation implies that there are regions in nuclear star
 clusters that are relaxed in angular momentum but not in
 energy; unfortunately, these regions are not well-resolved
 in most nearby galaxies by the Hubble Space Telescope. K.C.

The torus anchors magnetic fields which extract rotational energy from the hole in the form of two collimated beams of relativistic particles and fields. These in turn drive the observed radio jets and hot spots. A large supply of accreting gas is thus unnecessary and radio galaxies may be interpreted as starved quasars},

For expansion with Lorentz factors greater than or approximately equal to 1000 into a typical galactic environment, the corresponding time-scale in the frame of the observer is of the order of seconds. This mechanism would operate in any cosmological scenario of gamma-ray bursts involving initial energies of order a percent of a stellar rest mass, and implies photon energies and time-scales compatible with those observed in gamma-ray bursts.},

  Abstract                 = {We present ATHENA++ grid-based, hydrodynamic simulations of accretion on to Sagittarius A* via the stellar winds of the ?30 Wolf-Rayet stars within the central parsec of the galactic centre. These simulations span ?4 orders of magnitude in radius, reaching all the way down to 300 gravitational radii of the black hole, ?32 times further than in previous work. We reproduce reasonably well the diffuse thermal X-ray emission observed by Chandra in the central parsec. The resulting accretion flow at small radii is a superposition of two components: (1) a moderately unbound, sub-Keplerian, thick, pressure-supported disc that is at most (but not all) times aligned with the clockwise stellar disc, and (2) a bound, low-angular momentum inflow that proceeds primarily along the southern pole of the disc. We interpret this structure as a natural consequence of a few of the innermost stellar winds dominating accretion, which produces a flow with a broad distribution of angular momentum. Including the star S2 in the simulation has a negligible effect on the flow structure. Extrapolating our results from simulations with different inner radii, we find an accretion rate of approximately a few ×10-8 M? yr-1 at the horizon scale, consistent with constraints based on modelling the observed emission of Sgr A*. The flow structure found here can be used as more realistic initial conditions for horizon scale simulations of Sgr A*.},

These predictions disagree with afterglow observations of GRB 970508. We explored several variations on our model, but none seems to be able to change this result.

 been implicated in pre-supernova outbursts, supernova
 impostors, luminous blue variable eruptions, and some
 narrow-line and superluminous supernovae. To model these
 events, we investigate the dynamics of stars set in motion
 by strong acoustic pulses and wave trains, focusing on
 nonlinear wave propagation, shock formation, and an early
 phase of the development of a weak shock. We identify the
 shock formation radius, showing that a heuristic estimate
 based on crossing characteristics matches an exact
 expansion around the wave front and verifying both with
 numerical experiments. Our general analytical condition for
 shock formation applies to one-dimensional motions within
 any static environment, including both eruptions and
 implosions. We also consider the early phase of shock
 energy dissipation. We find that waves of super-Eddington
 acoustic luminosity always create shocks, rather than
 damping by radiative diffusion. Therefore, shock formation
 is integral to super-Eddington outbursts.},

  Abstract                 = {The interplay between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their environments is believed to command an essential role in galaxy evolution. The majority of these SMBHs are in the radiative inefficient accretion phase where this interplay remains elusive, but suggestively important, due to few observational constraints. To remedy this, we directly fit 2D hydrodynamic simulations to Chandra observations of Sgr A* with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, self-consistently modelling the 2D inflow-outflow solution for the first time. We find the temperature and density at flow onset are consistent with the origin of the gas in the stellar winds of massive stars in the vicinity of Sgr A*. We place the first observational constraints on the angular momentum of the gas and estimate the centrifugal radius, rc ? 0.056 rb ? 8 × 10-3 pc, where rb is the Bondi radius. Less than 1 per cent of the inflowing gas accretes on to the SMBH, the remainder being ejected in a polar outflow. We decouple the quiescent point-like emission from the spatially extended flow. We find this point-like emission, accounting for ?4 per cent of the quiescent flux, is spectrally too steep to be explained by unresolved flares, nor bremsstrahlung, but is likely a combination of a relatively steep synchrotron power law and the high-energy tail of inverse-Compton emission. With this self-consistent model of the accretion flow structure, we make predictions for the flow dynamics and discuss how future X-ray spectroscopic observations can further our understanding of the Sgr A* accretion flow.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the dynamics of supermassive black hole binaries
 embedded in circumbinary gaseous discs, with the smoothed
 particle hydrodynamics code GADGET-2. The subparsec binary
 (of total mass M and mass ratio q= 1/3) has excavated a gap
 and transfers its angular momentum to the self-gravitating
 disc (Mdisc= 0.2M). We explore the changes of the binary
 eccentricity, e, by simulating a sequence of binary models
 that differ in the initial eccentricity e0 only. In
 initially low-eccentric binaries, the eccentricity
 increases with time, while in high-eccentric binaries e
 declines, indicating the existence of a limiting
 eccentricity ecrit that is found to fall in the interval
 [0.6, 0.8]. We also present an analytical interpretation
 for this saturation limit. An important consequence of the
 existence of ecrit is the detectability of a significant
 residual eccentricity eLISA by the proposed gravitational
 wave detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). It
 is found that at the moment of entering the LISA frequency
 domain eLISAï¿½ 10-3-10-2, a signature of its earlier
 coupling with the massive circumbinary disc. We also
 observe large periodic inflows across the gap, occurring on
 the binary and disc dynamical time-scales rather than on
 the viscous time. These periodic changes in the accretion
 rate (with amplitudes up to ï¿½100 per cent, depending on
 the binary eccentricity) can be considered a fingerprint of
 eccentric subparsec binaries migrating inside a
 circumbinary disc.},

 massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) forming in galaxy
 mergers. In both stellar and gaseous environments, MBHBs
 are expected to grow large orbital eccentricities before
 they enter the gravitational wave (GW) observational
 domain. We re--visit the predicted eccentricities
 detectable by space based laser interferometers (as the
 proposed ELISA/NGO) for both environments. Close to
 coalescence, many MBHBs will still maintain detectable
 eccentricities, spanning a broad range from <10\^{}\{-5\}
 up to <\~{} 0.5. Stellar and gas driven dynamics lead to
 distinct distributions, with the latter favoring larger
 eccentricities. At larger binary separations, when emitted
 GWs will be observed by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), the
 expected eccentricities are usually quite large, in the
 range 0.01-0.7, which poses an important issue for signal
 modelling and detection algorithms. In this window, large
 eccentricities also have implications on proposed
 electromagnetic counterparts to the GW signal, which we
 briefly review.},

 existence of a precessing inner jet, whose kinematics has
 been discussed by Abraham \{\&\} Romero (1999). We now
 present a binary black hole model for the central engine of
 3C 273 where the rapid precession is tidally induced in the
 primary accretion disk inner region by a secondary black
 hole in a non-coplanar orbit. Using $\gamma$- and X-ray
 data we estimate upper limits for the mass of the primary,
 and then we compute the relevant parameters of the system
 for a variety of disk models. We also discuss some of the
 implications of the model for the electromagnetic and

 quasar 1928 + 738 (4C 73.18) observed with VLBI at 1.3 cm
 wavelength by Hummel et al. (1992). The period and
 amplitude of the wiggles can be explained as due to the
 orbital motion of a binary black hole with mass of order l0
 exp 8 solar masses, mass ratio larger than 0.1, and orbital
 radius about 10 exp 16 cm. The jet's inclination to the
 line of sight should be small confirming the standard
 interpretation of superluminal motion and one-sidedness as
 due to relativistic motion in a direction close to the line
 of sight. The small orbital radius suggests that the binary
 has been losing a significant amount of orbital energy
 during the last 10 exp 7 yr, possibly by interaction with
 the matter which is flowing through the active galactic
 nucleus. The arcsec-scale radio structure provides
 additional support for a link between activity and binary
 evolution. If our interpretation of the mass wiggle in this
 quasar is correct, then many other quasars may contain
 massive binary black holes as well.},

  abstract      = {We study the emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs) produced as radiation from black hole accretion propagates through an extended, optically thick envelope formed from stellar debris. We analytically describe key physics controlling spectrum formation, and present detailed radiative transfer calculations that model the spectral energy distribution and optical line strengths of TDEs near peak brightness. The steady-state transfer is coupled to a solver for the excitation and ionization states of hydrogen, helium, and oxygen (as a representative metal), without assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium. Our calculations show how an extended envelope can reprocess a fraction of soft X-rays and produce the observed optical fluxes of the order of 1043 erg s-1, with an optical/UV continuum that is not described by a single blackbody. Variations in the mass or size of the envelope may help explain how the optical flux changes over time with roughly constant color. For high enough accretion luminosities, X-rays can escape to be observed simultaneously with the optical flux. Due to optical depth effects, hydrogen Balmer line emission is often strongly suppressed relative to helium line emission (with He II-to-H line ratios of at least 5:1 in some cases) even in the disruption of a solar-composition star. We discuss the implications of our results to understanding the type of stars destroyed in TDEs and the physical processes responsible for producing the observed flares.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine unresolved nuclear X-ray sources in 57
 brightest cluster galaxies to study the relationship
 between nuclear X-ray emission and accretion on to
 supermassive black holes. The majority of the clusters in
 our sample have prominent X-ray cavities embedded in the
 surrounding hot atmospheres, which we use to estimate mean
 jet power and average accretion rate on to the supermassive
 black holes over the past several hundred Myr. We find that
 roughly half of the sample have detectable nuclear X-ray
 emission. The nuclear X-ray luminosity is correlated with
 average accretion rate determined using X-ray cavities,
 which is consistent with the hypothesis that nuclear X-ray
 emission traces ongoing accretion. The results imply that
 jets in systems that have experienced recent active
 galactic nucleus (AGN) outbursts, in the last Ëœ107 yr, are
 `on' at least half of the time. Nuclear X-ray sources
 become more luminous with respect to the mechanical jet
 power as the mean accretion rate rises. We show that
 nuclear radiation exceeds the jet power when the mean
 accretion rate rises above a few per cent of the Eddington
 rate, or a power output of {Ëœ }10^{45} {erg s^{-1}}, where
 the AGN apparently transitions to a quasar. The nuclear
 X-ray emission from three objects (A2052, Hydra A, M84)
 varies by factors of 2-10 on time-scales of 6 months to 10
 years. If variability at this level is a common phenomenon,
 it can account for much of the scatter in the relationship
 between mean accretion rate and nuclear X-ray luminosity.
 We find no significant change in the spectral energy
 distribution as a function of luminosity in the variable
 objects. The nuclear X-ray luminosity is consistent with
 emission from either a jet, an advection-dominated
 accretion flow, or a combination of the two, although other
 origins are possible. We also consider the longstanding
 problem of whether jets are powered by the accretion of
 cold circumnuclear gas or nearly spherical inflows of hot
 keV gas. For a subset of 13 nearby systems in our sample,
 we re-examine the relationship between the jet power and
 the Bondi accretion rate. The results indicate weaker
 evidence for a trend between Bondi accretion and jet power,
 due to uncertainties in the cavity volumes and gas
 densities at the Bondi radius. We suggest that cold gas
 fuelling could be a likely source of accretion power in
 these objects; however, we cannot rule out Bondi accretion,
 which could play a significant role in low-power jets.},

  Abstract                 = {A new general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamical
 code KORAL is described, which employs the M1 scheme to
 close the radiation moment equations. The code has been
 successfully verified against a number of tests.
 Axisymmetric simulations of super-critical magnetized
 accretion on non-rotating (a* = 0.0) and spinning (a* =
 0.9) black holes are presented. The accretion rates in the
 two models are dot{M}â‰ˆ 100-200 dot{M}_Edd. These first
 general relativistic simulations of super-critical black
 hole accretion are potentially relevant to tidal disruption
 events and hyper-accreting supermassive black holes in the
 early Universe. Both simulated models are optically and
 geometrically thick, and have funnels through which energy
 escapes in the form of relativistic gas, Poynting flux and
 radiative flux. The jet is significantly more powerful in
 the a* = 0.9 run. The net energy outflow rate in the two
 runs correspond to efficiencies of 5 per cent (a* = 0) and
 33 per cent (a* = 0.9), as measured with respect to the
 mass accretion rate at the black hole. These efficiencies
 agree well with those measured in previous simulations of
 non-radiative geometrically thick discs. Furthermore, in
 the a* = 0.9 run, the outflow power appears to originate in
 the spinning black hole, suggesting that the associated
 physics is again similar in non-radiative and
 super-critical accretion flows. While the two simulations
 are efficient in terms of total energy outflow, both runs
 are radiatively inefficient. Their luminosities are only
 Ëœ1-10LEdd, which corresponds to a radiative efficiency
 Ëœ0.1 per cent. Interestingly, most of the radiative
 luminosity emerges through the funnels where the local
 radiative flux is highly super-Eddington.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the correlations between the black hole
 mass $M_{BH}$, the velocity dispersion $\sigma$, the bulge
 mass $M_{Bu}$, the bulge average spherical density $\rho_h$
 and its spherical half mass radius $r_h$, constructing a
 database of 97 galaxies (31 core ellipticals, 17 power-law
 ellipticals, 30 classical bulges, 19 pseudo bulges) by
 joining 72 galaxies from the literature to 25 galaxies
 observed during our recent SINFONI black hole survey. For
 the first time we discuss the full error covariance matrix.
 We analyse the well known \msig\ and \mbu\ relations and
 establish the existence of statistically significant
 correlations between $M_{Bu}$ and $r_h$ and
 anti-correlations between $M_{Bu}$ and $\rho_h$. We
 establish five significant bivariate correlations
 (\msigrho, \msigr, \mbus, \mburho, \mbur) that predict
 $M_{BH}$ of 77 core and power-law ellipticals and classical
 bulges with measured and intrinsic scatter as small as
 $\approx 0.36$ dex and $\approx 0.33$ dex respectively, or
 0.26 dex when the subsample of 45 galaxies defined by
 \citet{KormendyHo2013} is considered. In contrast, pseudo
 bulges have systematically lower $M_{BH}$, but approach the
 predictions of all the above relations at spherical
 densities $\rho_h\ge 10^{10} M_\odot/kpc^3$ or scale
 lengths $r_h\le 1$ kpc. These findings fit in a scenario of
 co-evolution of BH and classical-bulge masses, where core
 ellipticals are the product of dry mergers of power-law
 bulges and power-law Es and bulges the result of (early)
 gas-rich mergers and of disk galaxies. In contrast, the
 (secular) growth of BHs is decoupled from the growth of
 their pseudo bulge hosts, except when (gas) densities are
 high enough to trigger the feedback mechanism responsible
 for the existence of the correlations between $M_{BH}$ and
 galaxy structural parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {In the afterglows of several gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), rapid temporal decay, which is inconsistent with spherical (isotropic) blast-wave models, is observed. In particular, GRB 980519 had the most rapidly fading of the well-documented GRB afterglows, with t-2.05+/-0.04 in optical as well as in X-rays. We show that such temporal decay is more consistent with the evolution of a jet after it slows down and spreads laterally, for which t-p decay is expected (where p is the index of the electron energy distribution). Such a beaming model would relax the energy requirements on some of the more extreme GRBs by a factor of several hundred. It is likely that a large fraction of the weak- (or no-) afterglow observations are also due to the common occurrence of beaming in GRBs and that their jets have already transitioned to the spreading phase before the first afterglow observations were made. With this interpretation, a universal value of p?2.4 is consistent with all data.},

  Abstract                 = {Aims: The study of tidal disruption flares from galactic
 nuclei has historically been hampered by a lack of high
 quality spectral observations taken around the peak of the
 outburst. Here we introduce the first results from a
 program designed to identify tidal disruption events at
 their peak by making near-real-time comparisons of the flux
 seen in XMM-Newton slew sources with that seen in ROSAT.
 Methods: Flaring extragalactic sources, which do not appear
 to be AGN, are monitored with Swift and XMM-Newton to track
 their temporal and spectral evolution. Timely optical
 observations are made to monitor the reaction of
 circumnuclear material to the X-ray flare. Results: SDSS
 J120136.02+300305.5 was detected in an XMM-Newton slew from
 June 2010 with a flux 56 times higher than an upper limit
 from ROSAT, corresponding to LX ~ 3 Ã— 1044 erg s-1. It has
 the optical spectrum of a quiescent galaxy (z = 0.146).
 Overall the X-ray flux has evolved consistently with the
 canonical t-5/3 model, expected for returning stellar
 debris, fading by a factor ~300 over 300 days. In detail
 the source is very variable and became invisible to Swift
 between 27 and 48 days after discovery, perhaps due to
 self-absorption. The X-ray spectrum is soft but is not the
 expected tail of optically thick thermal emission. It may
 be fit with a Bremsstrahlung or double-power-law model and
 is seen to soften with time and declining flux. Optical
 spectra taken 12 days and 11 months after discovery
 indicate a deficit of material in the broad line and
 coronal line regions of this galaxy, while a deep radio
 non-detection implies that a jet was not launched during
 this event. Partly based on observations collected at the
 German-Spanish Astronomical Center, Calar Alto, jointly
 operated by the Max-Planck-institut f{\"u}r Astronomie
 Heidelberg and the Instituto de Astrof{\'\i}sica de
 Andaluc{\'\i}a (CSIC) and observations made with the WHT
 operated on the island of La Palma by the Isaac Newton

  Abstract                 = {We discuss the importance of feedback via photoionization
 and Compton heating on the co-evolution of massive black
 holes (MBHs) at the centre of spheroidal galaxies, and
 their stellar and gaseous components. We first assess the
 energetics of the radiative feedback from a typical quasar
 on the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). We then
 demonstrate that the observed MBH-sigma relation could be
 established following the conversion of most of the gas of
 an elliptical progenitor into stars, specifically when the
 gas-to-stars mass ratio in the central regions has dropped
 to a low level ~0.01 or less, so that gas cooling is no
 longer able to keep up with the radiative heating by the
 growing central massive black hole (MBH). A considerable
 amount of the remaining gas will be expelled and both MBH
 accretion and star formation will proceed at significantly
 reduced rates thereafter, in agreement with observations of
 present-day ellipticals. We find further support for this
 scenario by evolving over an equivalent Hubble time a
 simple, physically based toy model that additionally takes
 into account the mass and energy return for the spheroid
 evolving stellar population, a physical ingredient often
 neglected in similar approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {We present surface photometry for the central regions of a
 sample of 48 spiral galaxies (mostly unbarred and barred of
 type Sbc or Sc) observed with the Space Telescope Imaging
 Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Surface
 brightness profiles (SBPs) were derived and modeled with a
 Nuker law. We also analyzed archival Wide Field Planetary
 Camera 2 images with a larger field of view, which are
 available for 18 galaxies in our sample. We modeled the
 extracted bulge SBPs with an exponential, an r1/4, or an rn
 profile. In agreement with previous studies, we find that
 bulges of Sbc galaxies fall into two categories: bulges
 well described by an exponential profile and those well
 described by an r1/4 profile. Only one galaxy requires the
 use of a more general S{\'e}rsic profile to properly
 describe the bulge. Nuclear photometrically distinct
 components are found in ~55% of the galaxies. For those
 that we classify as star clusters on the basis of their
 resolved extent, we find absolute magnitudes that are
 brighter on average than those previously identified in
 spiral galaxies. This might be due to a bias in our sample
 toward star-forming galaxies, combined with a trend for
 star-forming galaxies to host brighter central clusters.

 Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science

  Abstract                 = {Many galaxies are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centres-more than a million times the mass of the Sun. Measurements of stellar velocities and the discovery of variable X-ray emission have provided strong evidence in favour of such a black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, but have hitherto been unable to rule out conclusively the presence of alternative concentrations of mass. Here we report ten years of high-resolution astrometric imaging that allows us to trace two-thirds of the orbit of the star currently closest to the compact radio source (and massive black-hole candidate) Sagittarius A*. The observations, which include both pericentre and apocentre passages, show that the star is on a bound, highly elliptical keplerian orbit around Sgr A*, with an orbital period of 15.2 years and a pericentre distance of only 17 light hours. The orbit with the best fit to the observations requires a central point mass of (3.7 +/- 1.5) × 106 solar masses (M). The data no longer allow for a central mass composed of a dense cluster of dark stellar objects or a ball of massive, degenerate fermions.},

  Abstract                 = {The discovery that a substantial fraction of Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) exists in binaries with wide separations and roughly equal masses has motivated a variety of new theories explaining their formation. Goldreich and colleagues proposed two formation scenarios: In the first, a transient binary is formed, which becomes bound with the aid of dynamical friction from the sea of small bodies (L2s mechanism); in the second, a binary is formed by three-body gravitational deflection (L3 mechanism). Here, we accurately calculate the L2s and L3 formation rates for sub-Hill velocities. While the L2s formation rate is close to previous order of magnitude estimates, the L3 formation rate is about a factor of 4 smaller. For sub-Hill KBO velocities (vll vH) the ratio of the L3 to the L2s formation rate is 0.05(v/vH) , independent of the small bodies' velocity dispersion, their surface density, or their mutual collisions. For super-Hill velocities (vgg vH) the L3 mechanism dominates over the L2s mechanism. Binary formation via the L3 mechanism competes with binary destruction by passing bodies. Given sufficient time, a statistical equilibrium abundance of binaries forms. We show that the frequency of long-lived transient binaries drops exponentially with the system's lifetime and that such transient binaries are not important for binary formation via the L3 mechanism, contrary to Lee and colleagues. For the L2s mechanism we find that the typical time that transient binaries must last to form Kuiper Belt binaries (KBBs) for a given strength of dynamical friction, D, increases only logarithmically with D. Longevity of transient binaries (with lifetimes 15?-1 as suggested by Astakhov and colleagues) only becomes important for very weak dynamical friction (i.e., Dlesssim 0.002) and is most likely not crucial for KBB formation.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new semiempirical relation for the mass loss
 of cool stellar winds, which so far has frequently been
 described by ``Reimers' law.'' Originally, this relation
 was based solely on dimensional scaling arguments without
 any physical interpretation. In our approach, the wind is
 assumed to result from the spillover of the extended
 chromosphere, possibly associated with the action of waves,
 especially Alfv{\'e}n waves, which are used as guidance in
 the derivation of the new formula. We obtain a relation
 akin to the original Reimers law, but which includes two
 new factors. They reflect how the chromospheric height
 depends on gravity and how the mechanical energy flux
 depends, mainly, on the effective temperature. The new
 relation is tested and sensitively calibrated by modeling
 the blue end of the horizontal branch of globular clusters.
 The most significant difference from mass-loss rates
 predicted by the Reimers relation is an increase by up to a
 factor of 3 for luminous late-type (super)giants, in good
 agreement with observations.},

 gravitational wave antennas now being designed1?4. The
 signal is easily identified and contains enough information
 to determine the absolute distance to the binary,

  abstract      = {We construct evolutionary models of the populations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and supermassive black holes, in which the black hole mass function grows at the rate implied by the observed luminosity function, given assumptions about the radiative efficiency and the luminosity in Eddington units. We draw on a variety of recent X-ray and optical measurements to estimate the bolometric AGN luminosity function and compare to X-ray background data and the independent estimate of Hopkins et al. to assess remaining systematic uncertainties. The integrated AGN emissivity closely tracks the cosmic star-formation history, suggesting that star formation and black hole growth are closely linked at all redshifts. We discuss observational uncertainties in the local black hole mass function, which remain substantial, with estimates of the integrated black hole mass density ?? spanning the range 3-5.5 × 105 M sun Mpc-3. We find good agreement with estimates of the local mass function for a reference model where all active black holes have a fixed efficiency epsilon = 0.065 and L bol/L Edd ? 0.4 (shifting to epsilon = 0.09, L bol/L Edd ? 0.9 for the Hopkins et al. luminosity function). In our reference model, the duty cycle of 109 M sun black holes declines from 0.07 at z = 3 to 0.004 at z = 1 and 10-4 at z = 0. The decline is shallower for less massive black holes, a signature of "downsizing" evolution in which more massive black holes build their mass earlier. The predicted duty cycles and AGN clustering bias in this model are in reasonable accord with observational estimates. If the typical Eddington ratio declines at z < 2, then the "downsizing" of black hole growth is less pronounced. Models with reduced Eddington ratios at low redshift or black hole mass predict fewer low-mass black holes (M ? lsim 108 M sun) in the local universe, while models with black hole mergers predict more black holes at M ? > 109 M sun. Matching the integrated AGN emissivity to the local black hole mass density implies epsilon = 0.075 × (??/4.5 × 105 M sun Mpc-3)-1 for our standard luminosity function estimate, or 25% higher for Hopkins et al.'s estimate. It is difficult to reconcile current observations with a model in which most black holes have the high efficiencies epsilon ? 0.16-0.20 predicted by MHD simulations of disk accretion. We provide electronic tabulations of our bolometric luminosity function and our reference model predictions for black hole mass functions and duty cycles as a function of redshift.},

 The balance between tidal torques and viscosity maintain
 the inner edge of the disk at a radius
 \{\&\}rtilde;1.5a-2a, where a is the binary semimajor axis.
 Eventually, the inspiraling binary decouples from the disk
 and merges, leaving behind a central hollow (``donut
 hole'') in the disk orbiting the remnant black hole. We
 present a simple, time-dependent, Newtonian calculation
 that follows the secular (viscous) evolution of the disk as
 it fills up the hollow down to the black hole innermost
 stable circular orbit and then relaxes to stationary
 equilibrium. We use our model to calculate the
 electromagnetic radiation (``afterglow'') spectrum emitted
 during this transient accretion epoch. Observing the
 temporal increase in the total electromagnetic flux and the
 hardening of the spectrum as the donut hole fills may help
 confirm a binary black hole merger detected by a
 gravitational wave interferometer. We show how the very
 existence of the initial hollow can lead to super-Eddington
 accretion during this secular phase if the rate is not very
 far below Eddington prior to decoupling. Our model, though
 highly idealized, may be useful in establishing some of the
 key parameters, thermal emission features and scalings that
 characterize this transient. It can serve as a guide in the
 design and calibration of future
 radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations in general
 relativity.},

  Abstract                 = {We present global multidimensional numerical simulations of the plasma that pervades the dark matter haloes of clusters, groups and massive galaxies (the 'intracluster medium'; ICM). Observations of clusters and groups imply that such haloes are roughly in global thermal equilibrium, with heating balancing cooling when averaged over sufficiently long time- and length-scales; the ICM is, however, very likely to be locally thermally unstable. Using simple observationally motivated heating prescriptions, we show that local thermal instability (TI) can produce a multiphase medium - with Ëœ 104 K cold filaments condensing out of the hot ICM - only when the ratio of the TI time-scale in the hot plasma (tTI) to the free-fall time-scale (tff) satisfies tTI/tffâ‰² 10. This criterion quantitatively explains why cold gas and star formation are preferentially observed in low-entropy clusters and groups. In addition, the interplay among heating, cooling and TI reduces the net cooling rate and the mass accretion rate at small radii by factors of Ëœ 100 relative to cooling-flow models. This dramatic reduction is in line with observations. The feedback efficiency required to prevent a cooling flow is Ëœ 10-3 for clusters and decreases for lower mass haloes; supernova heating may be energetically sufficient to balance cooling in galactic haloes. We further argue that the ICM self-adjusts so that tTI/tffâ‰³ 10 at all radii. When this criterion is not satisfied, cold filaments condense out of the hot phase and reduce the density of the ICM. These cold filaments can power the black hole and/or stellar feedback required for global thermal balance, which drives tTI/tffâ‰³ 10. In comparison to clusters, groups have central cores with lower densities and larger radii. This can account for the deviations from self-similarity in the X-ray luminosity-temperature (?) relation. The high-velocity clouds observed in the Galactic halo can be due to local TI producing multiphase gas close to the virial radius if the density of the hot plasma in the Galactic halo is >rsim 10-5 cm-3 at large radii.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on the dynamical black hole (BH) mass estimates, NGC
 3115 hosts the closest billion solar mass BH. Deep studies
 of the center revealed a very underluminous active galactic
 nucleus (AGN) immersed in an old massive nuclear star
 cluster. Recent 1 Ms Chandra X-ray visionary project
 observations of the NGC 3115 nucleus resolved hot tenuous
 gas, which fuels the AGN. In this paper we connect the
 processes in the nuclear star cluster with the feeding of
 the supermassive BH. We model the hot gas flow sustained by
 the injection of matter and energy from the stars and
 supernova explosions. We incorporate electron heat
 conduction as the small-scale feedback mechanism, the
 gravitational pull of the stellar mass, cooling, and
 Coulomb collisions. Fitting simulated X-ray emission to the
 spatially and spectrally resolved observed data, we find
 the best-fitting solutions with chi2/dof = 1.00 for dof =
 236 both with and without conduction. The radial modeling
 favors a low BH mass <1.3 Ã— 109 M &sun;. The best-fitting
 supernova rate and the best-fitting mass injection rate are
 consistent with their expected values. The stagnation point
 is at r st <~ 1'', so that most of the gas, including the
 gas at a Bondi radius rB = 2''-4'', outflows from the
 region. We put an upper limit on the accretion rate at 2 Ã—
 10-3 M &sun; yr-1. We find a shallow density profile
 nvpropr -beta with beta â‰ˆ 1 over a large dynamic range.
 This density profile is determined in the feeding region
 0.''5-10'' as an interplay of four processes and effects:
 (1) the radius-dependent mass injection, (2) the effect of
 the galactic gravitational potential, (3) the accretion
 flow onset at r <~ 1'', and (4) the outflow at r >~ 1''.
 The gas temperature is close to the virial temperature Tv
 at any radius.},

  Abstract                 = {We study how the matter dispersed when a supermassive
 black hole tidally disrupts a star joins an accretion flow.
 Combining a relativistic hydrodynamic simulation of the
 stellar disruption with a relativistic hydrodynamics
 simulation of the subsequent debris motion, we track the
 evolution of such a system until ~= 80% of the stellar mass
 bound to the black hole has settled into an accretion flow.
 Shocks near the stellar pericenter and also near the
 apocenter of the most tightly bound debris dissipate
 orbital energy, but only enough to make its characteristic
 radius comparable to the semimajor axis of the most bound
 material, not the tidal radius as previously envisioned.
 The outer shocks are caused by post-Newtonian relativistic
 effects, both on the stellar orbit during its disruption
 and on the tidal forces. Accumulation of mass into the
 accretion flow is both non-monotonic and slow, requiring
 several to 10 times the orbital period of the most tightly
 bound tidal streams, while the inflow time for most of the
 mass may be comparable to or longer than the mass
 accumulation time. Deflection by shocks does, however,
 cause some mass to lose both angular momentum and energy,
 permitting it to move inward even before most of the mass
 is accumulated into the accretion flow. Although the
 accretion rate still rises sharply and then decays roughly
 as a power law, its maximum is ~= 0.1Ã— the previous
 expectation, and the timescale of the peak is ~= 5Ã— longer
 than previously predicted. The geometric mean of the black
 hole mass and stellar mass inferred from a measured event
 timescale is therefore ~= 0.2Ã— the value given by
 classical theory.},

  Abstract                 = {We study how the matter dispersed when a supermassive
 black hole tidally disrupts a star joins an accretion flow.
 Combining a relativistic hydrodynamic simulation of the
 stellar disruption with a relativistic hydrodynamics
 simulation of the tidal debris motion, we track such a
 system until ~80% of the stellar mass bound to the black
 hole has settled into an accretion flow. Shocks near the
 stellar pericenter and also near the apocenter of the most
 tightly-bound debris dissipate orbital energy, but only
 enough to make the characteristic radius comparable to the
 semi-major axis of the most-bound material, not the tidal
 radius as previously thought. The outer shocks are caused
 by post-Newtonian effects, both on the stellar orbit during
 its disruption and on the tidal forces. Accumulation of
 mass into the accretion flow is non-monotonic and slow,
 requiring ~3--10x the orbital period of the most
 tightly-bound tidal streams, while the inflow time for most
 of the mass may be comparable to or longer than the mass
 accumulation time. Deflection by shocks does, however,
 remove enough angular momentum and energy from some mass
 for it to move inward even before most of the mass is
 accumulated into the accretion flow. Although the accretion
 rate rises sharply and then decays roughly as a power-law,
 its maximum is ~0.1x the previous expectation, and the
 duration of the peak is ~5x longer than previously
 predicted. The geometric mean of the black hole mass and
 stellar mass inferred from a measured event timescale is
 therefore ~0.2x the value given by classical theory.},

  Abstract                 = {The afterglow emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is usually interpreted as synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons accelerated at the GRB external shock. We investigate the temporal decay of the afterglow emission at late times, when the bulk of the shock-accelerated electrons are non-relativistic (the "deep Newtonian phase," as denoted by Huang and Cheng). We assume that the electron spectrum in the deep Newtonian phase is a power-law distribution in momentum with slope p, as dictated by the theory of Fermi acceleration in non-relativistic shocks. For a uniform circumburst medium, the deep Newtonian phase begins at t{_{\scriptsize {DN}}}\sim 3\,\epsilon _{e,-1}^{5/6}t{_{\scriptsize {ST}}}, where t ST marks the transition of the blast wave to the non-relativistic, spherically symmetric Sedov-Taylor (ST) solution, and epsilon e = 0.1 epsilon e, -1 quantifies the amount of shock energy transferred to the electrons. For typical parameters, the deep Newtonian stage starts ~0.5 to several years after the GRB. The radio flux in this phase decays as F ?vpropt -3(p + 1)/10vpropt -(0.9÷1.2), for a power-law slope 2 < p < 3. This is shallower than the scaling F ?vpropt -3(5p - 7)/10vpropt -(0.9÷2.4) derived by Frail et al., which only applies if the GRB shock is non-relativistic, but the electron distribution still peaks at ultra-relativistic energies (a regime that is relevant for a narrow time interval, and only if t DN >~ t ST, namely, epsilon e >~ 0.03). We discuss how the deep Newtonian phase can be reliably used for GRB calorimetry, and we comment on the good detection prospects of trans-relativistic blast waves at 0.1÷10 GHz with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and LOw-Frequency ARray.},

  Abstract                 = {We use hydrodynamical simulations to study the color
 transformations induced by star formation and active
 galactic nuclei (AGNs) during major mergers of spiral
 galaxies. Our modeling accounts for radiative cooling, star
 formation, and supernova feedback. Moreover, we include a
 treatment of accretion onto supermassive black holes
 embedded in the nuclei of the merging galaxies. We assume
 that a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of an
 accreting black hole couples thermally to surrounding gas,
 providing a feedback mechanism that regulates its growth.
 The encounter and coalescence of the galaxies triggers
 nuclear gas inflow, which fuels both a powerful starburst
 and strong black hole accretion. Comparing simulations with
 and without black holes, we show that AGN feedback can
 quench star formation and accretion on a short timescale,
 particularly in large galaxies where the black holes can
 drive powerful winds once they become sufficiently massive.
 The color evolution of the remnant differs markedly between
 mergers with and without central black holes. Without AGNs,
 gas-rich mergers lead to elliptical galaxies that remain
 blue owing to residual star formation, even after more than
 7 Gyr have elapsed. In contrast, mergers with black holes
 produce elliptical galaxies that redden much faster, an
 effect that is more pronounced in massive remnants where a
 nearly complete termination of star formation occurs,
 allowing them to redden to u-r\~{}=2.3 in less than 1 Gyr.
 AGN feedback may thus be required to explain the population
 of extremely red massive early-type galaxies, and it
 appears to be an important driver in generating the
 observed bimodal color distribution of galaxies in the
 local universe.},

  abstract      = {Most, if not all, stars in the field are born in binary
 configurations or higher multiplicity systems. In dense
 stellar environment such as the Galactic Center (GC), many
 stars are expected to be in binary configurations as well.
 These binaries form hierarchical triple-body systems, with
 the massive black hole (MBH) as the third, distant object.
 The stellar binaries are expected to undergo
 large-amplitude eccentricity and inclination oscillations
 via the so-called `eccentric Kozai-Lidov' mechanism. These
 eccentricity excitations, combined with post-main-sequence
 stellar evolution, can drive the inner stellar binaries to
 merge. We study the mergers of stellar binaries in the
 inner 0.1 pc of the GC caused by gravitational
 perturbations due to the MBH. We run a large set of Monte
 Carlo simulations that include the secular evolution of the
 orbits, general relativistic precession, tides and
 post-main-sequence stellar evolution. We find that about 13
 per cent of the initial binary population will have merged
 after a few Myr and about 29 per cent after a few Gyr.
 These expected merged systems represent a new class of
 objects at the GC, and we speculate that they are connected
 to G2-like objects and the young stellar population.},

  Abstract                 = {We report the discovery of a transient source in the
 central regions of galaxy cluster A267. The object, which
 we call ``PALS-1,'' was found in a survey aimed at
 identifying highly magnified Lyman break galaxies in the
 fields of intervening rich clusters. At discovery, the
 source had Un>24.7 (2 sigma AB), g=21.96+/-0.12, and very
 blue g-r and r-i colors; i.e., PALS-1 was a ``U-band
 dropout,'' characteristic of star-forming galaxies and
 quasars at z~3. However, 3 months later the source had
 faded by more than 3 mag. Further observations showed a
 continued decline in luminosity, to R>26.4 at 7 months
 after discovery. Although the apparent brightness suggests
 a supernova at roughly the cluster redshift, we show that
 the photometry and light curve argue against any known type
 of supernova at any redshift. The spectral energy
 distribution and location near the center of a galaxy
 cluster are consistent with the hypothesis that PALS-1 is a
 gravitationally lensed transient at z~3.3. If this
 interpretation is correct, the source is magnified by a
 factor of 4-7, and two counterimages are predicted. Our
 lens model predicts that there are time delays between the
 three images of 1-10 yr and that we have witnessed the
 final occurrence of the transient. The intense luminosity
 (MAB~-23.5 after correcting for lensing) and blue UV
 continuum (implying T>~50,000 K) argue that the source may
 have been a flare resulting from the tidal disruption of a
 star by a 106-108 Msolar black hole. Regardless of its
 physical nature, PALS-1 highlights the importance of
 monitoring regions of high magnification in galaxy clusters
 for distant time-varying phenomena. Based on observations
 with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the
 Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by
 AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. Based on
 observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which
 is operated jointly by the California Institute of

  Abstract                 = {A new code for astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is described. The code has been designed to be easily extensible for use with static and adaptive mesh refinement. It combines higher order Godunov methods with the constrained transport (CT) technique to enforce the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. Discretization is based on cell-centered volume averages for mass, momentum, and energy, and face-centered area averages for the magnetic field. Novel features of the algorithm include (1) a consistent framework for computing the time- and edge-averaged electric fields used by CT to evolve the magnetic field from the time- and area-averaged Godunov fluxes, (2) the extension to MHD of spatial reconstruction schemes that involve a dimensionally split time advance, and (3) the extension to MHD of two different dimensionally unsplit integration methods. Implementation of the algorithm in both C and FORTRAN95 is detailed, including strategies for parallelization using domain decomposition. Results from a test suite which includes problems in one-, two-, and three-dimensions for both hydrodynamics and MHD are given, not only to demonstrate the fidelity of the algorithms, but also to enable comparisons to other methods.

  Abstract                 = {The tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black
 hole (SMBH) is a highly energetic event with consequences
 dependent on the degree to which the star plunges inside
 the SMBH's tidal sphere. We introduce a new analytic model
 for tidal disruption events (TDEs) to analyse the
 dependence of these events on beta, the ratio of the tidal
 radius to the orbital pericentre. We find, contrary to most
 previous work, that the spread in debris energy for a TDE
 is largely constant for all beta. This result has important
 consequences for optical transient searches targeting TDEs,
 which we discuss. We quantify leading-order general
 relativistic corrections to this spread in energy and find
 that they are small. We also examine the role of stellar
 spin and find that a combination of spin-orbit
 misalignment, rapid rotation and high beta may alter the
 spread in debris energy. Finally, we quantify for the first
 time the gravitational wave emission due to the strong
 compression of a star in a high-beta TDE. Although this
 signal is unlikely to be detectable for disruptions of
 main-sequence stars, the tidal disruption of a white dwarf
 by an intermediate mass black hole can produce a strong
 signal visible to Advanced LIGO at tens of megaparsecs.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent observations suggest that stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) are strongly overrepresented in rare, post-starburst galaxies. Several dynamical mechanisms have been proposed to elevate their TDE rates, ranging from central stellar overdensities to the presence of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. Another such mechanism, introduced here, is a radial velocity anisotropy in the nuclear star cluster produced during the starburst. These, and other, dynamical hypotheses can be disentangled by comparing observations to theoretical predictions for the TDE delay time distribution (DTD). We show that SMBH binaries are a less plausible solution for the post-starburst preference, as they can only reproduce the observed DTD with extensive fine-tuning. The overdensity hypothesis produces a reasonable match to the observed DTD (based on the limited data currently available), provided that the initial stellar density profile created during the starburst, ?(r), is exceptional in both steepness and normalization. In particular, explaining the post-starburst preference requires ??r-? with ? ? 2.5, i.e. much steeper than the classic Bahcall-Wolf equilibrium profile of ? = 7/4. For `ultrasteep' density cusps (? ? 9/4), we show that the TDE rate decays with time measured since the starburst as \dot{N} ? t^{-(4? -9)/(2? -3)} / ln t. Radial anisotropies may represent a promising explanation, although the currently observed distribution of TDE host masses appears too bottom-heavy for this scenario. TDE rates in initially anisotropic cusps will decay roughly as \dot{N} ? t^{-? _0}. As the sample of TDEs with well-studied host galaxies grows, the DTD will become a powerful tool for constraining the exceptional dynamical properties of post-starburst galactic nuclei.},

  Abstract                 = {Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) and supermassive black holes
 (SMBHs) both inhabit galactic nuclei, coexisting in a range
 of bulge masses, but excluding each other in the largest or
 smallest galaxies. We propose that the transformation of
 NSCs into SMBHs occurs via runaway tidal captures, once
 NSCs exceed a certain critical central density and velocity
 dispersion. The bottleneck in this process, as with all
 collisional runaways, is growing the first e-fold in black
 hole mass. The growth of a stellar mass black hole past
 this bottleneck occurs as tidally captured stars are
 consumed in repeated episodes of mass transfer at
 pericenter. Tidal captures may turn off as a growth channel
 once the black hole reaches a mass ~100-1000 solar masses,
 but tidal disruption events will continue and appear
 capable of growing the seed SMBH to larger sizes. The
 runaway slows (becomes sub-exponential) once the seed SMBH
 consumes the core of its host NSC. While the bulk of the
 cosmic mass density in SMBHs is ultimately produced (via
 the Soltan-Paczynski argument) by episodic gaseous
 accretion in very massive galaxies, the smallest SMBHs have
 probably grown from strong tidal encounters with NSC stars.
 SMBH seeds that grow for a time $t$ entirely through this
 channel will follow simple power law relations with the
 velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, of their host galaxy. In the
 simplest regime it is $M_\bullet \sim
 \sigma^{3/2}\sqrt{M_\star t / G} \sim 10^{6}M_\odot (\sigma
 / 50~{\rm km~s}^{-1})^{3/2}(t/10^{10}~{\rm yr})^{1/2}$, but
 the exponents and prefactor can differ slightly depending
 on the details of loss cone refilling. Current tidal
 disruption event rates predicted from this mechanism are
 consistent with observations.},

 binaries (BHBs) which are formed in the self-gravitating

 three-body scattering and gaseous drag are effective
 mechanisms that reduce the semimajor axis of a BHB to radii
 where gravitational waves take over, on time-scales shorter
 than the typical lifetime of the AGN disc. Taking
 observationally motivated assumptions for the rate of star
 formation in AGN discs, we find a rate of disc-induced BHB
 mergers (R Ëœ 3 yr^{-1} Gpc^{-3}, but with large
 uncertainties) that is comparable with existing estimates
 of the field rate of BHB mergers, and the approximate BHB
 merger rate implied by the recent Advanced LIGO detection
 of GW150914. BHBs formed thorough this channel will
 frequently be associated with luminous AGN, which are
 relatively rare within the sky error regions of future
 gravitational wave detector arrays. This channel could also
 possess a (potentially transient) electromagnetic
 counterpart due to super-Eddington accretion on to the
 stellar mass black hole following the merger.},

 black holes (IMBHs), we report the results of ultra-deep
 Jansky Very Large Array radio continuum observations of the
 cores of three Galactic globular clusters: M15, M19, and
 M22. We reach rms noise levels of 1.5-2.1 muJy beam-1 at an
 average frequency of 6 GHz. No sources are observed at the
 center of any of the clusters. For a conservative set of
 assumptions about the properties of the accretion, we set
 3sigma upper limits on IMBHs from 360 to 980 M &sun;. These
 limits are among the most stringent obtained for any
 globular cluster. They add to a growing body of work that
 suggests either (1) IMBHs >~ 1000 M &sun; are rare in
 globular clusters or (2) when present, IMBHs accrete in an
 extraordinarily inefficient manner.},

  Abstract                 = {Was PS1-10jh (Gezari et al. 2012), an optical/UV transient
 discovered by the Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Survey, the tidal
 disruption of a star by a massive black hole? We address
 two aspects of the problem: the composition of the putative
 disrupted object (using the spectroscopic data), and the
 energetics of the observed gas and radiation (using the
 photometric data). We perform photoionization calculations
 and compare with the observed lower limit of the line ratio
 L(He II 4686)/L(Halpha) > 5 to argue that this event was
 not the disruption of a solar-type star, and instead was
 likely the disruption of a helium core (as first proposed
 by Gezari et al. 2012). Disruption of such a dense object
 requires a relatively small central BH, M_BH <~ 2 x 10^5
 M_sun. We use the photometric data to infer that PS1-10jh
 comprised an outflow of ~ 0.01 M_sun of gas, escaping from
 the BH at ~1000 km/s, and we propose that this outflow was
 driven primarily by radiation pressure trapped by Thomson
 and resonance line scattering. The large ratio of radiated
 energy to kinetic energy, E_rad/E_K ~ 10^4, together with
 the large value of E_rad ~ 2 x 10^(51) erg, suggests that
 the outflow was shocked at large radius (perhaps similar to
 super-luminous supernovae or the internal shock model for
 gamma-ray bursts). We describe puzzles in the physics of
 PS1-10jh, and discuss how this event may help us understand
 future tidal disruptions and super-Eddington accretion
 events as well.},

  Abstract                 = {During the tidal disruption of a main-sequence star by a
 massive black hole (BH) having mass MBHâ‰² 107 M&sun;, the
 stellar debris is expected to fall back to the BH at a rate
 well above the Eddington rate. Some fraction of this gas is
 predicted to be blown away from the BH, producing an
 optically bright flare of radiation. We predict the spectra
 and spectral evolution of tidal disruption events, focusing
 on the signatures produced by photoionized gas outside the
 photosphere of this super-Eddington outflow. We show that
 the spectrum of such an outflow should show absorption
 lines that are strongly blueshifted relative to the host
 galaxy, are typically very broad (0.01-0.1c) and are most
 prominent at ultraviolet wavelengths (e.g. C IV, Lyman
 alpha, O VI) at early times (â‰²1 month for a Ëœ106 M&sun;
 BH). There may also be optical absorption lines of hydrogen
 and He II if there is a lower velocity component to the
 outflow (â‰²0.01c). At later times, the outflow falls out
 of thermal equilibrium and the continuum emission likely
 hardens - the absorption lines will then primarily be in
 the soft X-rays. Supernovae in galactic nuclei are a
 significant source of confusion in optical surveys for
 tidal disruption events: we estimate that nuclear Type Ia
 supernovae are two orders of magnitude more common than
 tidal disruption events at zËœ 0.1 for ground-based
 surveys. Nuclear Type II supernovae occur at a comparable
 rate but can be excluded by pre-selecting red galaxies. The
 contamination from nuclear supernovae can be reduced to a
 manageable level by using high-resolution follow-up imaging
 with adaptive optics or the Hubble Space Telescope. Our
 predictions should help optical transient surveys
 capitalize on their potential for discovering tidal
 disruption events.},

  Abstract                 = {A star that wanders too close to a massive black hole (BH)
 is shredded by the BH's tidal gravity. Stellar gas falls
 back to the BH at a rate initially exceeding the Eddington
 rate, releasing a flare of energy. In anticipation of
 upcoming transient surveys, we predict the light curves and
 spectra of tidal flares as a function of time, highlighting
 the unique signatures of tidal flares at optical and
 near-infrared wavelengths. A reasonable fraction of the gas
 initially bound to the BH is likely blown away when the
 fallback rate is super-Eddington at early times. This
 outflow produces an optical luminosity comparable to that
 of a supernova; such events have durations of ~10 d and may
 have been missed in supernova searches that exclude the
 nuclear regions of galaxies. When the fallback rate
 subsides below Eddington, the gas accretes onto the BH via
 a thin disc whose emission peaks in the ultraviolet to soft
 X-rays. Some of this emission is reprocessed by the unbound
 stellar debris, producing a spectrum of very broad emission
 lines (with no corresponding narrow forbidden lines). These
 lines are the strongest for BHs with MBH ~ 105-106Msolar
 and thus optical surveys are particularly sensitive to the
 lowest mass BHs in galactic nuclei. Calibrating our models
 to ROSAT and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)
 observations, we predict detection rates for Panoramic
 Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS),
 the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and the Large Synoptic
 Survey Telescope (LSST) and highlight some of the
 observational challenges associated with studying tidal
 disruption events in the optical. Upcoming surveys such as
 Pan-STARRS should detect at least several events per year,
 and may detect many more if current models of outflows
 during super-Eddington accretion are reasonably accurate.
 These surveys will significantly improve our knowledge of
 stellar dynamics in galactic nuclei, the physics of
 super-Eddington accretion, the demography of intermediate
 mass BHs and the role of tidal disruption in the growth of
 massive BHs.},

 engine, the final kinetic energy of the SN is variable and
 sensitive to the structure of each pre-SN star. Many
 progenitors with extended core structures do not explode,
 but become black holes (BHs), and the masses of exploding
 stars do not form a simply connected set. The resulting
 nucleosynthesis agrees reasonably well with the Sun
 provided that a reasonable contribution from SNe Ia is also
 allowed, but with a deficiency of light s-process isotopes.
 The resulting neutron star initial mass function has a mean
 gravitational mass near 1.4 {M}&sun; . The average BH mass
 is about 9 {M}&sun; if only the helium core implodes, and
 14 {M}&sun; if the entire pre-SN star collapses. Only Ëœ10%
 of SNe come from stars over 20 {M}&sun; , and some of these
 are Type Ib or Ic. Some useful systematics of Type IIp
 light curves are explored.},

  Abstract                 = {We demonstrate, using a simple analytic model, that the
 presence of a massive satellite can globally modify the
 structure and emission properties of an accretion disc to
 which it is tidally coupled. We show, using two levels of
 numerical approximation, that the analytic model gives
 reasonable results. The results are applicable to two
 astrophysical situations. For an active galactic nucleus,
 we consider the case of a \~{}10\^{}3 M\_solar compact
 companion to the central black hole, and show that it could
 modulate the emitted spectrum on a time-scale of
 \~{}10\^{}5 yr. In the case of a T Tauri accretion disc, a
 satellite such as a subdwarf or giant planet could modify
 the disc spectral energy distribution over a substantial
 fraction of the T Tauri star lifetime.},

  Abstract                 = {The unusual transient Swift J1644+57 likely resulted from
 a collimated relativistic jet, powered by the sudden onset
 of accretion on to a massive black hole (BH) following the
 tidal disruption (TD) of a star. However, several mysteries
 cloud the interpretation of this event, including (1) the
 extreme flaring and `plateau' shape of the X-ray/gamma-ray
 light curve during the first t - ttrig Ëœ 10 d after the
 gamma-ray trigger; (2) unexpected rebrightening of the
 forward shock radio emission at t - ttrig Ëœ months; (3)
 lack of obvious evidence for jet precession, despite the
 misalignment typically expected between the angular
 momentum of the accretion disc and BH; (4) recent abrupt
 shut-off in the jet X-ray emission at t - ttrig Ëœ 1.5 yr.
 Here, we show that all of these seemingly disparate
 mysteries are naturally resolved by one assumption: the
 presence of strong magnetic flux Phi* threading the BH.
 Just after the TD event, Phi* is dynamically weak relative
 to the high rate of fall-back accretion dot{M}, such that
 the accretion disc (jet) freely precesses about the BH axis
 = our line of sight. As dot{M} decreases, however, Phi*
 becomes dynamically important, leading to a state of
 `magnetically arrested disk' (MAD). MAD naturally aligns
 the jet with the BH spin, but only after an extended phase
 of violent rearrangement (jet wobbling), which in Swift
 J1644+57 starts a few days before the gamma-ray trigger and
 explains the erratic early light curve. Indeed, the entire
 X-ray light curve can be fitted to the predicted power-law
 decay dot{M} âˆ t^{-alpha } (alpha ~= 5/3 - 2.2) if the TD
 occurred a few weeks prior to the gamma-ray trigger. Jet
 energy directed away from the line of sight, either prior
 to the trigger or during the jet alignment process,
 eventually manifests as the observed radio rebrightening,
 similar to an off-axis (orphan) gamma-ray burst afterglow.
 As suggested recently, the late X-ray shut-off occurs when
 the disc transitions to a geometrically thin (jetless)
 state once dot{M} drops below Ëœthe Eddington rate. We
 predict that, in several years, a transition to a low/hard
 state will mark a revival of the jet and its associated
 X-ray emission. We use our model for Swift J1644+57 to
 constrain the properties of the BH and disrupted star,
 finding that a solar mass main-sequence star disrupted by a
 relatively low-mass M* Ëœ 105-106 M&sun; BH is consistent
 with the data, while a white dwarf disruption (though still
 possible) is disfavoured. The magnetic flux required to
 power Swift J1644+57 is much too large to be supplied by
 the star itself, but it could be collected from a quiescent
 `fossil' accretion disc that was present in the galactic
 nucleus prior to the TD. The presence (lack of) of such a
 fossil disc could be a deciding factor in what TD events
 are accompanied by powerful jets.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this paper is to set constraints on the epochs
 of early-type galaxy formation through the ``archaeology''
 of the stellar populations in local galaxies. Using our
 models of absorption-line indices that account for variable
 abundance ratios, we derive ages, total metallicities, and
 element ratios of 124 early-type galaxies in high- and
 low-density environments. The data are analyzed by
 comparison with mock galaxy samples created through Monte
 Carlo simulations taking the typical average observational
 errors into account, in order to eliminate artifacts caused
 by correlated errors. We find that all three parameters,
 age, metallicity, and alpha/Fe ratio, are correlated with
 velocity dispersion. We show that these results are robust
 against recent revisions of the local abundance pattern at
 high metallicities. To recover the observed scatter we need
 to assume an intrinsic scatter of about 20% in age, 0.08
 dex in [Z/H], and 0.05 dex in [alpha/Fe]. All low-mass
 objects with M*<~1010Msolar (sigma<~130km s-1) show
 evidence for the presence of intermediate-age stellar
 populations with low alpha/Fe ratios. About 20% of the
 intermediate-mass objects with 1010<~M*/Msolar<~1011
 [110<~sigma/(kms-1)<~230 both elliptical and lenticular
 galaxies] must have either a young subpopulation or a blue
 horizontal branch. On the basis of the above relationships,
 valid for the bulk of the sample, we show that the Mg-sigma
 relation is mainly driven by metallicity, with similar
 contributions from the alpha/Fe ratio (23%) and age (17%).
 We further find evidence for an influence of the
 environment on the stellar population properties. Massive
 early-type galaxies in low-density environments seem on
 average ~2 Gyr younger and slightly (~0.05-0.1 dex) more
 metal-rich than their counterparts in high-density
 environments. No offsets in the alpha/Fe ratios are instead
 detected. With the aid of a simple chemical evolution
 model, we translate the derived ages and alpha/Fe ratios
 into star formation histories. We show that most star
 formation activity in early-type galaxies is expected to
 have happened between redshifts ~3 and 5 in high-density
 environments and between redshifts 1 and 2 in low-density
 environments. We conclude that at least 50% of the total
 stellar mass density must have already formed at z~1, in
 good agreement with observational estimates of the total
 stellar mass density as a function of redshift. Our results
 suggest that significant mass growth in the early-type
 galaxy population below z~1 must be restricted to less
 massive objects, and a significant increase of the stellar
 mass density between redshifts 1 and 2 should be present,
 caused mainly by the field galaxy population. The results
 of this paper further imply the presence of vigorous star
 formation episodes in massive objects at z~2-5 and evolved
 elliptical galaxies around z~1, both observationally
 identified as SCUBA galaxies and extremely red objects,
 respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {It is argued that the collapse which forms the
 supermassive black holes that are likely to exist in the
 nuclei of many quasars and galaxies, and collisions between
 those holes, should produce strong broadband bursts of
 gravitational waves. The mean time between such
 gravitational-wave bursts at earth is analyzed in terms of
 the present Hubble expansion rate, the present deceleration
 parameter of the universe, the redshift z = 2.5 (at which
 most of the bursts are assumed to have been generated), the
 present number density of 'centers' where the bursts
 originated, the mean number of bursts generated in each
 center during its active life, and the speed of light. The
 analysis shows that the range from one week to 300 years is
 reasonable for the time between bursts, although it is
 admitted that hardly any bursts at all is also reasonable.
 Expected characteristics of the bursts are deduced, and it
 is shown that the best detector for these bursts will
 probably be Doppler tracking of one or more interplanetary
 spacecraft.},

 the usual relaxation and shooting schemes appearing in the

 number of grid points), robust, efficiently makes use of
 multiple processor cores and/or nodes and is freely
 available in source form for use and distribution. We
 verify the code against analytic solutions and results from
 other oscillation codes, in all cases finding good
 agreement. Then, we use the code to explore how the
 asteroseismic observables of a 1.5 M&sun; star change as it
 evolves through the red-giant bump.},

An eccentric disk can also explain the rotation curve and asymmetric dispersion profile revealed by ground-based observations. The central object must be smaller than ~1 pc so that the potential felt by the disk is nearly Keplerian. The disk eccentricity may be excited by dynamical friction from the bulge.},

 shock wave is not supported by recent observations. We
 propose a model in which the forward shock is invisible and
 afterglow is emitted by a long-lived reverse shock in the
 burst ejecta. It explains observed optical and X-ray light
 curves, including the plateau at 103-104 s with a peculiar
 chromatic break, and the second break that was previously
 associated with a beaming angle of the explosion. The
 plateau forms following a temporary drop of the
 reverse-shock pressure much below the forward-shock
 pressure. A simplest formalism that can describe such blast
 waves is the ``mechanical'' model; we use it in our
 calculations.},

  Abstract                 = {According to the virial theorem, all gravitational systems
 in equilibrium sit on a plane in the three-dimensional
 parameter space defined by their mass, size, and second
 moment of the velocity tensor. While these quantities
 cannot be directly observed, there are suitable proxies:
 the luminosity L k , half-light radius R e , and dispersion
 {? }e. These proxies indeed lie on a very tight fundamental
 plane (FP). How do the black holes (BHs) in the centers of
 galaxies relate to the FP? Their masses are known to
 exhibit no strong correlation with total galaxy mass, but
 they do correlate weakly with bulge mass (when present),
 and extremely well with the velocity dispersion through the
 {M}\bullet \propto {? }e5.4 relation. These facts together
 imply that a tight plane must also exist defined by BH
 mass, total galaxy mass, and size. Here, I show that this
 is indeed the case using a heterogeneous set of 230 BHs.
 The sample includes BHs from zero to 10 billion solar
 masses and host galaxies ranging from low surface
 brightness dwarfs, through bulgeless disks, to brightest
 cluster galaxies. The resulting BH-size-luminosity relation
 {M}\bullet \propto {({L}k/{R}e)}3.8 has the same amount of
 scatter as the M ?-? relation and is aligned with the
 galaxy FP, such that it is just a reprojection of {? }e.
 The inferred BH-size-mass relation is {M}\bullet \propto
 {({M}\star /{R}e)}2.9. These relationships are universal
 and extend to galaxies without bulges. This implies that
 the BH is primarily correlated with its global velocity
 dispersion and not with the properties of the bulge. I show
 that the classical bulge-mass relation is a projection of
 the M ?-? relation. When the velocity dispersion cannot be
 measured (at high z or low dispersions), the BH-size-mass
 relation should be used as a proxy for BH mass in favor of
 just galaxy or bulge mass.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a new method to determine the relative
 contributions of different types of stars to the integrated
 light of nearby early-type galaxies. As is well known, the
 surface brightness of these galaxies shows pixel-to-pixel
 fluctuations due to Poisson variations in the number of
 giant stars. Differential spectroscopy of pixels as a
 function of fluctuation strength ("fluctuation
 spectroscopy") effectively measures the spectral variation
 of stars as a function of their luminosity, information
 that is otherwise difficult to obtain for individual stars
 outside of the Local Group. We apply this technique to the
 elliptical galaxy NGC 4472, using HST/ACS imaging in six
 narrow-band ramp filters tuned to spectral features in the
 range 0.8-1.0 micron. Pixels with +- 5% broad-band
 variations show differential color variations of 0.1% -
 1.0% in the narrow-band filters. These variations are
 primarily due to the systematic increase in TiO absorption
 strength with increasing luminosity on the upper giant
 branch. The data are very well reproduced by the same
 Conroy & van Dokkum (2012) stellar population synthesis
 model that is the best fit to the integrated light, with
 residuals in the range 0.03% - 0.09%. Models with ages or
 metallicities that are significantly different from the
 integrated-light values do not yield good fits. We can also
 rule out several modifications to the underlying model,
 including the presence of a significant (>3% of the light)
 population of late M giants. The current observations
 constitute a powerful test of the expected luminosities and
 temperatures of metal-rich giants in massive early-type
 galaxies. Studies of pixels with much larger (negative)
 fluctuations will provide unique information on main
 sequence stars and the stellar initial mass function.},

  Abstract                 = {Starting as highly relativistic collimated jets, gamma-ray burst outflows gradually slow down and become nonrelativistic spherical blast waves. Although detailed analytical solutions describing the afterglow emission received by an on-axis observer during both the early and late phases of the outflow evolution exist, a calculation of the received flux during the intermediate phase and for an off-axis observer requires either a more simplified analytical model or direct numerical simulations of the outflow dynamics. In this paper, we present light curves for off-axis observers covering the long-term evolution of the blast wave, calculated from a high-resolution two-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamics simulation using a synchrotron radiation model. We compare our results to earlier analytical work and calculate the consequence of the observer angle with respect to the jet axis both for the detection of orphan afterglows and for jet break fits to the observational data. We confirm earlier results in the literature finding that only a very small number of local type Ibc supernovae can harbor an orphan afterglow. For off-axis observers, the observable jet break can be delayed up to several weeks, potentially leading to overestimation of the beaming-corrected total energy. In addition we find that, when using our off-axis light curves to create synthetic Swift X-ray data, jet breaks are likely to remain hidden in the data.},

  Abstract                 = {Gamma-ray burst afterglow flares and rebrightenings of the
 optical and X-ray light curves have been attributed to both
 late-time inner engine activity and density changes in the
 medium surrounding the burster. To test the latter, we
 study the encounter between the relativistic blast wave
 from a gamma-ray burster and a stellar wind termination
 shock. The blast wave is simulated using a high-performance
 adaptive mesh relativistic hydrodynamic code, AMRVAC, and
 the synchrotron emission is analysed in detail with a
 separate radiation code. We find no bump in the resulting
 light curve, not even for very high density jumps.
 Furthermore, by analysing the contributions from the
 different shock wave regions we are able to establish that
 it is essential to resolve the blast wave structure in
 order to make qualitatively correct predictions on the
 observed output and that the contribution from the reverse
 shock region will not stand out, even when the magnetic
 field is increased in this region by repeated shocks. This
 study resolves a controversy in the recent literature.},

  Abstract                 = {We report an observational estimate of the rate of stellar
 tidal disruption flares (TDFs) in inactive galaxies based
 on a successful search for these events among transients in
 galaxies using archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
 multi-epoch imaging data (Stripe 82). This search yielded
 186 nuclear flares in galaxies, 2 of which are excellent
 TDF candidates. Because of the systematic nature of the
 search, the very large number of galaxies, the long time of
 observation, and the fact that non-TDFs were excluded
 without resorting to assumptions about TDF characteristics,
 this study provides an unparalleled opportunity to measure
 the TDF rate. To compute the rate of optical stellar tidal
 disruption events, we simulate our entire pipeline to
 obtain the efficiency of detection. The rate depends on the
 light curves of TDFs, which are presently still poorly
 constrained. Using only the observed part of the SDSS light
 curves gives a model-independent upper limit to the optical
 TDF rate, \dot{N}<2\times 10^{-4}\,yr^{-1}\,galaxy^{-1}
 (90% CL), under the assumption that the SDSS TDFs are
 representative examples. We develop three empirical models
 of the light curves based on the two SDSS light curves and
 two more recent and better-sampled Pan-STARRS TDF light
 curves, leading to our best estimate of the rate:
 \dot{N}_TDF = (1.5{--}2.0)_{-1.3}^{+2.7} \times 10^{-5}
 \,yr^{-1}\, galaxy^{-1}. We explore the modeling
 uncertainties by considering two theoretically motivated
 light curve models, as well as two different relationships
 between black hole mass and galaxy luminosity, and two
 different treatments of the cutoff in the visibility of
 TDFs at large M BH. From this we conclude that these
 sources of uncertainty are not significantly larger than
 the statistical ones. Our results are applicable for
 galaxies hosting black holes with mass in the range of a
 few 106-108 M &sun;, and translates to a volumetric TDF
 rate of (4-8) Ã— 10-8 $\pm$ 0.4 yr-1 Mpc-3, with the
 statistical uncertainty in the exponent.},

  Abstract                 = {Using archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) multi-epoch
 imaging data (Stripe 82), we have searched for the tidal
 disruption of stars by supermassive black holes in
 non-active galaxies. Two candidate tidal disruption events
 (TDEs) are identified. The TDE flares have optical
 blackbody temperatures of 2 Ã— 104 K and observed peak
 luminosities of Mg = -18.3 and -20.4 (nuL nu = 5 Ã— 1042, 4
 Ã— 1043 erg s-1, in the rest frame); their cooling rates
 are very low, qualitatively consistent with expectations
 for tidal disruption flares. The properties of the TDE
 candidates are examined using (1) SDSS imaging to compare
 them to other flares observed in the search, (2) UV
 emission measured by GALEX, and (3) spectra of the hosts
 and of one of the flares. Our pipeline excludes optically
 identifiable AGN hosts, and our variability monitoring over
 nine years provides strong evidence that these are not
 flares in hidden AGNs. The spectra and color evolution of
 the flares are unlike any SN observed to date, their strong
 late-time UV emission is particularly distinctive, and they
 are nuclear at high resolution arguing against these being
 first cases of a previously unobserved class of SNe or more
 extreme examples of known SN types. Taken together, the
 observed properties are difficult to reconcile with an SN
 or an AGN-flare explanation, although an entirely new
 process specific to the inner few hundred parsecs of
 non-active galaxies cannot be excluded. Based on our
 observed rate, we infer that hundreds or thousands of TDEs
 will be present in current and next-generation optical
 synoptic surveys. Using the approach outlined here, a TDE
 candidate sample with O(1) purity can be selected using
 geometric resolution and host and flare color alone,
 demonstrating that a campaign to create a large sample of
 TDEs, with immediate and detailed multi-wavelength
 follow-up, is feasible. A by-product of this work is
 quantification of the power spectrum of extreme flares in
 AGNs.},

  Abstract                 = {Context. Many decades of observations of active galactic
 nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries have shown that
 relativistic jets are ubiquitous when compact objects
 accrete. One could therefore anticipate the launch of a jet
 after a star is disrupted and accreted by a massive black
 hole. This birth of a relativistic jet may have been
 observed recently in two stellar tidal disruption flares
 (TDFs), which were discovered in gamma-rays by Swift. Yet
 no transient radio emission has been detected from the tens
 of TDF candidates that were discovered at optical to soft
 X-ray frequencies. Because the sample that was followed-up
 at radio frequencies is small, the non-detections can be
 explained by Doppler boosting, which reduces the jet flux
 for off-axis observers. And since the existing follow-up
 observation are mostly within ~10 months of the discovery,
 the non-detections can also be due to a delay of the radio
 emission with respect to the time of disruption. Aims: We
 wish to test the conjecture that all TDFs launch jets.
 Methods: We present 5 GHz follow-up observations with the
 Jansky VLA of seven known TDFs, a significant increase of
 the number of radio observations of these events. To avoid
 missing delayed jet emission, our observations probe 1-8
 years since the estimated time of disruption. Results: None
 of the sources are detected, with very deep upper limits at
 the 10 micro Jansky level. These observations rule out the
 hypothesis that these TDFs launched jets similar to
 radio-loud quasars. We also constrain the possibility that
 the flares hosted a jet identical to Sw 1644+57, the first
 and best-sampled relativistic TDF. Conclusions: We thus
 obtain evidence for a dichotomy in the stellar tidal
 disruption population, implying that the jet launching
 mechanism is sensitive to the parameters of the
 disruption.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an approach for simulating the collisional evolution of spherical isotropic stellar systems based on the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation. A novel aspect is that we use the phase volume as the argument of the distribution function instead of the traditionally used energy, which facilitates the solution. The publicly available code PhaseFlow implements a high-accuracy finite-element method for the Fokker-Planck equation, and can handle multiple-component systems, optionally with the central black hole and taking into account loss-cone effects and star formation. We discuss the energy balance in the general setting, and in application to the Bahcall-Wolf cusp around a central black hole, for which we derive a perturbative solution. We stress that the cusp is not a steady-state structure, but rather evolves in amplitude while retaining an approximately ? \propto {r}-7/4 density profile. Finally, we apply the method to the nuclear star cluster of the milky Way, and illustrate a possible evolutionary scenario in which a two-component system of lighter main-sequence stars and stellar-mass black holes develops a Bahcall-Wolf cusp in the heavier component and a weaker ? \propto {r}-3/2 cusp in the lighter, visible component, over the period of several Gyr.

 sources in these can be explained if the birth velocities
 of neutron stars are higher than estimated from velocity
 measurements of radio pulsars, or if the initial mass
 function steepens at high masses. The authors perform a
 statistical test on the distribution of X-ray sources with
 respect to the number of close encounters in globular
 clusters, and find satisfactory agreement between the tidal
 capture theory and observation, apart from the presence of
 low-mass X-ray binaries in four clusters with a very low
 encounter rate: Ter 1, Ter 2, Gr 1 and NGC 6712.},

  Abstract                 = {We present follow-up observations of an optical transient
 (OT) discovered by ROTSE on 2009 January 21. Photometric
 monitoring was carried out with ROTSE-IIIb in the optical
 and Swift in the UV up to +70 days after discovery. The
 light curve showed a fast rise time of ~10 days followed by
 a steep decline over the next 60 days, which was much
 faster than that implied by 56Ni---56Co radioactive decay.
 The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 database
 contains a faint, red object at the position of the OT,
 which appears slightly extended. This and other lines of
 evidence suggest that the OT is of extragalactic origin,
 and this faint object is likely the host galaxy. A sequence
 of optical spectra obtained with the 9.2 m Hobby-Eberly
 Telescope between +8 and +45 days after discovery revealed
 a hot, blue continuum with no visible spectral features. A
 few weak features that appeared after +30 days probably
 originated from the underlying host. Fitting synthetic
 templates to the observed spectrum of the host galaxy
 revealed a redshift of z = 0.19. At this redshift, the peak
 magnitude of the OT is close to -22.5, similar to the
 brightest super-luminous supernovae; however, the lack of
 identifiable spectral features makes the massive stellar
 death hypothesis less likely. A more plausible explanation
 appears to be the tidal disruption of a Sun-like star by
 the central supermassive black hole. We argue that this
 transient likely belongs to a class of super-Eddington
 tidal disruption events.},

 accreting black hole, classified as an active galactic
 nucleus. However, many stellar systems are plausibly
 expected to host black holes, from globular clusters to
 nuclear star clusters, to massive galaxies. The mere
 presence of stars in the vicinity of a black hole provides
 a source of fuel via mass loss of evolved stars. In this
 paper, we assess the expected luminosities of black holes
 embedded in stellar systems of different sizes and
 properties, spanning a large range of masses. We model the
 distribution of stars and derive the amount of gas
 available to a central black hole through a geometrical
 model. We estimate the luminosity of the black holes under
 simple, but physically grounded, assumptions on the
 accretion flow. Finally, we discuss the detectability of
 "quiescent" black holes in the local universe.},

  Abstract                 = {We assess models for the assembly of supermassive black
 holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies that trace their
 hierarchical buildup far up in the dark halo ``merger
 tree.'' Motivated by the recent discovery of luminous
 quasars around redshift z\~{}6-suggesting a very early
 assembly epoch-and by numerical simulations of the
 fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds in cold dark
 matter (CDM) cosmogonies, we assume that the first ``seed''
 black holes (BHs) had intermediate masses and formed in
 (mini)halos collapsing at z\~{}20 from high-? density
 fluctuations. As these pregalactic holes become
 incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and
 larger halos, they sink to the center because of dynamical
 friction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger
 remnant to become supermassive, form a binary system, and
 eventually coalesce. The merger history of dark matter
 halos and associated BHs is followed by cosmological Monte
 Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times
 until the present in a ?CDM cosmology. A simple model,
 where quasar activity is driven by major mergers and SMBHs
 accrete at the Eddington rate a mass that scales with the
 fifth power of the circular velocity of the host halo, is
 shown to reproduce the observed luminosity function of
 optically selected quasars in the redshift range 1<z<5. A
 scheme for describing the hardening of a BH binary in a
 stellar background with core formation due to mass ejection
 is applied, where the stellar cusp proportional to r-2 is
 promptly regenerated after every major merger event,
 replenishing the mass displaced by the binary. Triple BH
 interactions will inevitably take place at early times if
 the formation route for the assembly of SMBHs goes back to
 the very first generation of stars, and we follow them in
 our merger tree. The assumptions underlying our scenario
 lead to the prediction of a population of massive BHs
 wandering in galaxy halos and the intergalactic medium at
 the present epoch and contributing <\~{}10 percent to the
 total BH mass density, ?SMBH=4?105 Msolar Mpc-3 (h=0.7).
 The fraction of binary SMBHs in galaxy nuclei is on the
 order of 10 percent today, and it increases with redshift
 so that almost all massive nuclear BHs at early epochs are

  Abstract                 = {Aims: We study the massive stars in OB associations and
 their surrounding interstellar medium environment, using a
 population synthesis code. Methods: We developed a new
 population synthesis code for groups of massive stars,
 where we model the emission of different forms of energy
 and matter from the stars of the association. In
 particular, the ejection of the two radioactive isotopes
 26Al and 60Fe is followed, as well as the emission of
 hydrogen ionizing photons, and the kinetic energy of the
 stellar winds and supernova explosions. We investigate
 various alternative astrophysical inputs and the resulting
 output sensitivities, especially effects due to the
 inclusion of rotation in stellar models. As the aim of the
 code is the application to relatively small populations of
 massive stars, special care is taken to address their
 statistical properties. Our code incorporates both
 analytical statistical methods applicable to small
 populations, as well as extensive Monte Carlo simulations.
 Results: We find that the inclusion of rotation in the
 stellar models has a large impact on the interactions
 between OB associations and their surrounding interstellar
 medium. The emission of 26Al in the stellar winds is
 strongly enhanced, compared to non-rotating models with the
 same mass-loss prescription. This compensates the recent
 reductions in the estimates of mass-loss rates of massive
 stars due to the effects of clumping. Despite the lower
 mass-loss rates, the power of the winds is actually
 enhanced for rotating stellar models. The supernova power
 (kinetic energy of their ejecta) is decreased due to longer
 lifetimes of rotating stars, and therefore the wind power
 dominates over supernova power for the first 6 Myr after a
 burst of star-formation. For populations typical of nearby
 star-forming regions, the statistical uncertainties are
 large and clearly non-Gaussian.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the detailed physics of the feedback mechanism
 by relativistic active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets
 interacting with a two-phase fractal interstellar medium
 (ISM) in the kpc-scale core of galaxies using 29
 three-dimensional grid-based hydrodynamical simulations.
 The feedback efficiency, as measured by the amount of cloud
 dispersal generated by the jet-ISM interactions, is
 sensitive to the maximum size of clouds in the fractal
 cloud distribution but not to their volume filling factor.
 Feedback ceases to be efficient for Eddington ratios P
 jet/L edd <~ 10-4, although systems with large cloud
 complexes >~ 50 pc require jets of Eddington ratio in
 excess of 10-2 to disperse the clouds appreciably. Based on
 measurements of the bubble expansion rates in our
 simulations, we argue that sub-grid AGN prescriptions
 resulting in negative feedback in cosmological simulations
 without a multi-phase treatment of the ISM are good
 approximations if the volume filling factor of warm-phase
 material is less than 0.1 and the cloud complexes are
 smaller than ~25 pc. We find that the acceleration of the
 dense embedded clouds is provided by the ram pressure of
 the high-velocity flow through the porous channels of the
 warm phase, flow that has fully entrained the shocked
 hot-phase gas it has swept up, and is additionally mass
 loaded by ablated cloud material. This mechanism transfers
 10% to 40% of the jet energy to the cold and warm gas,
 accelerating it within a few 10 to 100 Myr to velocities
 that match those observed in a range of high- and
 low-redshift radio galaxies hosting powerful radio jets.},

  Abstract                 = {Mrk 1216 is a nearby, early-type galaxy with a small
 effective radius of 2.8 kpc and a large stellar velocity
 dispersion of 308 km s-1 for its K-band luminosity of 1.4? {10}11 {L}? . Using integral field spectroscopy assisted by
 adaptive optics from Gemini North, we measure spatially
 resolved stellar kinematics within ?450 pc of the galaxy
 nucleus. The galaxy exhibits regular rotation with
 velocities of ?180 km s-1 and a sharply peaked velocity
 dispersion profile that reaches 425 km s-1 at the center.
 We fit axisymmetric, orbit-based dynamical models to the
 combination of these high angular resolution kinematics,
 large-scale kinematics extending to roughly three effective
 radii, and Hubble Space Telescope imaging, resulting in a
 constraint of the mass of the central black hole in Mrk
 1216. After exploring several possible sources of
 systematics that commonly affect stellar-dynamical black
 hole mass measurements, we find a black hole mass of
 {M}{BH}=(4.9+/- 1.7)?{10}9 {M}? and an H-band stellar
 mass-to-light ratio of {{{\Upsilon }}}H=1.3+/- 0.4
 {{{\Upsilon }}}? (1? uncertainties). Mrk 1216 is consistent
 with the local black hole mass-stellar velocity dispersion
 relation, but is a factor of ?5-10 larger than expectations
 from the black hole mass-bulge luminosity and black hole
 mass-bulge mass correlations when conservatively using the
 galaxy?s total luminosity or stellar mass. This behavior is
 quite similar to the extensively studied compact galaxy NGC
 1277. Resembling the z? 2 quiescent galaxies, Mrk 1216 may
 be a passively evolved descendant, and perhaps reflects a
 previous era when galaxies contained over-massive black
 holes relative to their bulge luminosities/masses, and the
 growth of host galaxies had yet to catch up.},

We find that the re-brightening feature in the radio light curve can be naturally explained by the two-component jet model. The possible origin of this structured jet are the Blandford-Znajek and Blandford-Payne mechanisms. We also show that this two-component jet model can interpret the two kinds of quasi-periodic variations in the X-ray light curve: a 200 second quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) and a 2.7-day quasi-periodic variation. The latter is interpreted by a precessing outer jet launched near the Bardeen-Petterson radius of a warped disk. The $\sim$ 200s QPO could be associated with a second, narrower jet sweeping the observer line-of-sight periodically, which is launched from a spinning black hole in the misaligned direction with respect to the black hole's angular momentum.},

  Abstract                 = {Tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes at
 the centers of galaxies is expected to produce unique
 emission-line signatures, which have not yet been explored
 adequately. Here we report the discovery of extremely
 strong coronal lines from [Fe X] up to [Fe XIV] in a sample
 of seven galaxies (including two recently reported cases),
 which we interpret as such signatures. This is the first
 systematic search for objects of this kind, by making use
 of the immense database of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
 The galaxies, which are non-active as evidenced by the
 narrow line ratios, show broad emission lines of complex
 profiles in more than half of the sample. Both the
 high-ionization coronal lines and the broad lines are
 fading on timescales of years in objects observed with
 spectroscopic follow-ups, suggesting their transient
 nature. Variations of inferred non-stellar continua, which
 have absolute magnitudes of at least -16 to -18 mag in the
 g band, are also detected in more than half of the sample.
 The coronal line emitters reside in sub-L * disk galaxies
 (-21.3 < Mi < -18.5) with small stellar velocity
 dispersions. The sample seems to form two distinct types
 based on the presence or absence of the [Fe VII] lines,
 with the latter having relatively low luminosities of [O
 III], [Fe XI], and the host galaxies. These characteristics
 can most naturally be understood in the context of
 transient accretion onto intermediate-mass black holes at
 galactic centers following tidal disruption of stars in a
 gas-rich environment. We estimate the incidence of such
 events to be around 10-5 yr-1 for a galaxy with -21.3 < Mi
 < -18.5.},

  Abstract                 = {Three-dimensional simulations of hydrodynamic jets are
 computed at rather high resolution using the ZEUS-3D code.
 The parameters we employ are suitable for
 moderate-to-high-power radio jets emerging through a
 galactic atmosphere or halo and eventually crossing a
 tilted pressure-matched interface with a hotter
 intracluster medium. Before they cross this interface,
 these simulations aim the jets so that they hit massive
 clouds within the galactic halo, with densities 10 or more
 times higher than the ambient atmospheric density and
 hundreds to thousands times the jet density. Such clouds
 are set up with radii several times that of the jet and
 could correspond to giant molecular cloud complexes or
 small cannibalized galaxies. We find that while powerful
 jets eventually disperse the clouds, for off-center
 collisions, nonaxisymmetric instabilities are induced in
 those jets. Those instabilities grow faster for lower Mach
 number jets and can disrupt the jets substantially sooner
 than occurs for similar simulations of jets not hitting
 clouds. Such interactions could be related to some compact
 steep-spectrum source morphologies. Weak jets can be
 effectively halted or destroyed by reasonably massive
 clouds, and this type of interaction may have relevance for
 the paucity of extended radio jets in spiral galaxies.
 Slow, dense jets may be bent yet remain stable for fairly
 extended times, and such interactions can be responsible
 for some of the wide-angle tail and most of the ``dogleg''
 radio source morphologies.},

  Abstract                 = {The tidal interaction of a protoplanet with a
 circumstellar gaseous disk results in mutual angular
 momentum exchange that modifies both the disk and the orbit
 of the secondary. There are two, conceptually distinct
 circumstances wherein nebula torques can cause a secular
 variation in a protoplanet's semimajor axis. (I) The net
 torque exerted on a secondary by an undisturbed disk is
 not, in general, zero. Although gradients in the disk
 density and temperature can contribute to this torque, it
 is mostly due to asymmetries in the disk/planet interaction
 that are inherent to a Keplerian disk. For a relatively
 thick disk, the differential torque can be a significant
 fraction of the torque from either its exterior or its
 interior portion. In this case, the protoplanet drifts
 relative to disk material on a time scale inversely
 proportional to its mass. (II) The protoplanet opens a gap
 in the disk that establishes a flow barrier to disk
 material. A density discontinuity that locks the
 protoplanet into the disk's viscous evolution develops
 across the orbit. The protoplanet migrates on a time scale
 set by the disk's viscosity. A unified model that clarifies
 the relationship between these migration types and reveals
 under what circumstances a given type is selected is
 presented. In both cases, orbital decay is the prevailing
 outcome, although type I migration rates can be between one
 and two orders of magnitudes faster than type II. Estimates
 of orbital lifetimes are given and are generally shorter
 than the expected lifetime of the disk. Some implications
 to the issue of planetary formation are discussed.},

 detected by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) over
 its lifetime. Therefore, these multiple TD events provide a
 novel method for identifying SMBH binary systems with
 parsec to subparsec separations. The rates of TDs are
 investigated using simulations of non-interacting stars
 initially orbiting a primary SMBH and the potential of the
 model stellar cusp. The stars are then evolved forward in
 time and perturbed by a secondary SMBH inspiraling from the
 edge of the cusp to its stalling radius. We find with
 conservative magnitude estimates that the next-generation
 transient survey LSST should detect multiple TDs in
 approximately three galaxies over five years of
 observation, though less conservative estimates could
 increase this rate by an order of magnitude.},

  Abstract                 = {A weakly nonlinear fluid wave propagating within a star can be unstable to three-wave interactions. The resonant parametric instability is a well-known form of three-wave interaction in which a primary wave of frequency ? a excites a pair of secondary waves of frequency ? b + ? c ~= ? a . Here we consider a nonresonant form of three-wave interaction in which a low-frequency primary wave excites a high-frequency p-mode and a low-frequency g-mode such that ? b + ? c Gt ? a . We show that a p-mode can couple so strongly to a g-mode of similar radial wavelength that this type of nonresonant interaction is unstable even if the primary wave amplitude is small. As an application, we analyze the stability of the tide in coalescing neutron star binaries to p-g mode coupling. We find that the equilibrium tide and dynamical tide are both p-g unstable at gravitational wave frequencies f gw >~ 20 Hz and drive short wavelength p-g mode pairs to significant energies on very short timescales (much less than the orbital decay time due to gravitational radiation). Resonant parametric coupling to the tide is, by contrast, either stable or drives modes at a much smaller rate. We do not solve for the saturation of the p-g instability and therefore we cannot say precisely how it influences the evolution of neutron star binaries. However, we show that if even a single daughter mode saturates near its wave breaking amplitude, the p-g instability of the equilibrium tide will (1) induce significant orbital phase errors (?phi >~ 1 radian) that accumulate primarily at low frequencies (f gw <~ 50 Hz) and (2) heat the neutron star core to a temperature of T ~ 1010 K. Since there are at least ~100 unstable p-g daughter pairs, ?phi and T are potentially much larger than these values. Tides might therefore significantly influence the gravitational wave signal and electromagnetic emission from coalescing neutron star binaries at much larger orbital separations than previously thought.},

  Abstract                 = {The location accuracy of the BeppoSAX Wide Field Cameras and acute ground-based follow-up have led to the detection of a decaying afterglow in X-rays and optical light following the classical gamma-ray burst GRB 970228. The afterglow in X-rays and optical light fades as a power law at all wavelengths. This behaviour was predicted for a relativistic blast wave that radiates its energy when it decelerates by ploughing into the surrounding medium. Because the afterglow has continued with unchanged behaviour for more than a month, its total energy must be of order 1051 erg, placing it firmly at a redshift of order 1. Further tests of the model are discussed, some of which can be performed with available data, and implications for future observing strategies are pointed out. We discuss how the afterglow can provide a probe for the nature of the burst sources.},

  Abstract                 = {We search the literature for reports on the spectral
 properties of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries when
 they have accretion luminosities between 1034 and 1036 erg
 s-1, corresponding to roughly 0.01-1 per cent of the
 Eddington accretion rate for a neutron star. We found that
 in this luminosity range the photon index (obtained from
 fitting a simple absorbed power law in the 0.5-10 keV
 range) increases with decreasing 0.5-10 keV X-ray
 luminosity (i.e. the spectrum softens). Such behaviour has
 been reported before for individual sources, but here we
 demonstrate that very likely most (if not all) neutron star
 systems behave in a similar manner and possibly even follow
 a universal relation. When comparing the neutron star
 systems with black hole systems, it is clear that most
 black hole binaries have significantly harder spectra at
 luminosities of 1034-1035 erg s-1. Despite a limited number
 of data points, there are indications that these spectral
 differences also extend to the 1035-1036 erg s-1 range, but
 above a luminosity of 1035 erg s-1 the separation between
 neutron star and black hole systems is not as clear as
 below. In addition, the black hole spectra only become
 softer below luminosities of 1034 erg s-1 compared to 1036
 erg s-1 for the neutron star systems. This observed
 difference between the neutron star binaries and black hole
 ones suggests that the spectral properties (between 0.5 and
 10 keV) at 1034-1035 erg s-1 can be used to tentatively
 determine the nature of the accretor in unclassified X-ray
 binaries. More observations in this luminosity range are
 needed to determine how robust this diagnostic tool is and
 whether or not there are (many) systems that do not follow
 the general trend. We discuss our results in the context of
 properties of the accretion flow at low luminosities and we
 suggest that the observed spectral differences likely arise
 from the neutron star surface becoming dominantly visible
 in the X-ray spectra. We also suggest that both the thermal
 component and the non-thermal component might be caused by
 low-level accretion on to the neutron star surface for
 luminosities below a few times 1034 erg s-1.},

  Abstract                 = {The mass of supermassive black holes at the centre of
 galaxies is tightly correlated with the mass of the galaxy
 bulges which host them. This observed correlation implies a
 mechanism of joint growth, but the precise physical
 processes responsible are a matter of some debate. Here, we
 report on the growth of black holes in 400 local galactic
 bulges which have experienced a strong burst of star
 formation in the past 600Myr. The black holes in our sample
 have typical masses of 106.5-107.5Msolar and the active
 nuclei have bolometric luminosities of the order of
 1042-1044ergs-1. We combine stellar continuum indices with
 Halpha luminosities to measure a decay time-scale of
 ~300Myr for the decline in star formation after a
 starburst. During the first 600Myr after a starburst, the
 black holes in our sample increase their mass by on-average
 5 per cent and the total mass of stars formed is about 103
 times the total mass accreted on to the black hole. This
 ratio is similar to the ratio of stellar to black hole mass
 observed in present-day bulges. We find that the average
 rate of accretion of matter on to the black hole rises
 steeply roughly 250Myr after the onset of the starburst. We
 show that our results are consistent with a simple model in
 which 0.5 per cent of the mass lost by intermediate-mass
 stars in the bulge is accreted by the black hole, but with
 a suppression in the efficiency of black hole growth at
 early times plausibly caused by supernova feedback, which
 is stronger at earlier times. We suggest this picture may
 be more generally applicable to black hole growth, and
 could help explain the strong correlation between bulge and
 black hole mass.},

Jet evolution is followed from a collimated relativistic outflow to the quasi-spherical non-relativistic phase. We show that relativistic sideways expansion becomes significant beyond the radius r ? at which the expansion Lorentz factor drops to ?-1 0. This is consistent with simple analytic estimates, which predict faster sideways expansion than has been claimed based on earlier numerical modeling. For t > ts = r ?/c the emission of radiation from the jet blast wave is similar to that of a spherical blast wave carrying the same energy (significant deviations at t ~ ts occur only for well off-axis observers, ?obs ~ 1 Gt ?0). Thus, the total (calorimetric) energy of gamma-ray burst blast waves may be estimated with only a small fractional error based on t > ts observations.},

 available at the outer boundary can finally fall on to the
 black hole, while most of it is lost in the outflow; (ii)
 electrons can directly receive a large fraction of the
 viscously dissipated energy in the accretion flow (i.e.
 delta Ëœ 0.1-0.5). The radiative efficiency of the hot
 accretion flow when these two findings are taken into
 account has not yet been systematically studied, and this
 is the subject of our paper. We consider two regimes of the
 hot accretion model: advection-dominated accretion flows
 that lie in the regime of the low accretion rate,
 â‰²10alpha2L Edd /c2, and the luminous hot accretion flows
 (LHAFs) that lie above this accretion rate. For the LHAFs,
 we assume that the accretion flow has a two-phase structure
 above a certain accretion rate, and we adopt a
 simplification in our calculation of the dynamics. Our
 results indicate that the radiative efficiency of hot
 accretion flow increases with the accretion rate and that
 it is greatly enhanced by the direct viscous heating to
 electrons, compared to the previous case of delta â‰ª 1.
 When the accretion rate is high, the radiative efficiency
 of the hot accretion flow is comparable to that of a
 standard thin disc. We present fitting formulae of
 radiative efficiency as a function of accretion rate for
 various values of delta.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop an analytic, steady-state model for the gas environment in quiescent galactic nuclei. We assume that the mass is constantly supplied by a spherically symmetric distribution of wind emitting stars, and that gravity is solely due to a central supermassive black hole. In such flows, the bulk velocity vanishes at a finite radius, called the stagnation radius. Matter generated below that radius will be accreted onto the black hole, while matter outside it will escape the system. Under certain conditions, the flow may become supersonic at both domains. From dimensional analysis, the stagnation radius is proportional to the ratio between the gravitational parameter of the central black hole and the wind velocity squared. In this work, we demonstrate how to determine the exact position of the stagnation radius. We also obtain radial profiles of the hydrodynamic variables and verify them using a time-dependent hydrodynamic simulation. We delineate the conditions under which radiative cooling can be neglected, and predict the luminosity and spectrum of the free-free X-ray emission from such a system. We use the insights from this work to settle a tension regarding the distribution of wind emitting stars around the Galactic centre, which arose in a previous study. In addition, we describe how radio emission from tidal disruption events can be used to infer information about wind emitting distributions in other galaxies.},

  Abstract                 = {Passive red galaxies frequently contain warm ionized gas
 and have spectra similar to low-ionization nuclear
 emission-line regions (LINERs). Here we investigate the
 nature of the ionizing sources powering this emission, by
 comparing nuclear spectroscopy from the Palomar survey with
 larger aperture data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We
 find the line emission in the majority of passive red
 galaxies is spatially extended; the Halpha surface
 brightness profile depends on radius r as r -1.28. We
 detect strong line ratio gradients with radius in [N
 II]/Halpha, [S II]/Halpha, and [O III]/[S II], requiring
 the ionization parameter to increase outward. Combined with
 a realistic gas density profile, this outward increasing
 ionization parameter convincingly rules out active galactic
 nuclei (AGNs) as the dominant ionizing source and strongly
 favors distributed ionizing sources. Sources that follow
 the stellar density profile can additionally reproduce the
 observed luminosity dependence of the line ratio gradient.
 Post-asymptotic giant branch stars provide a natural
 ionization source candidate, though they have an ionization
 parameter deficit. Velocity width differences among
 different emission lines disfavor shocks as the dominant
 ionization mechanism, and suggest that the interstellar
 medium in these galaxies contains multiple components. We
 conclude that the line emission in most LINER-like galaxies
 found in large-aperture (>100 pc) spectroscopy is not
 primarily powered by AGN activity and thus does not trace
 the AGN bolometric luminosity. However, they can be used to
 trace warm gas in these red galaxies.},

  Abstract                 = {We present results of follow-up optical spectroscopic
 Multi-Mirror Telescope (MMT) observations of seven rare,
 extreme coronal line-emitting galaxies reported by Wang et
 al. Large variations in coronal lines are found in four
 objects, making them strong candidates for tidal disruption
 events (TDEs). For the four TDE candidates, all the coronal
 lines with ionization states higher than [Fe VII] disappear
 within 5-9 yr. The [Fe VII] line faded by a factor of about
 five in one object (J0952+2143) within 4 yr, whereas the
 line emerged in another two objects that previously did not
 show the line. A strong increment in the [O III] flux is
 observed, shifting the line ratios toward the loci of
 active galactic nuclei on the BPT diagram. Surprisingly, we
 detect a non-canonical [O III] lambda5007/[O III]
 lambda4959 ratio of ~= 2 in two objects, indicating a large
 column density of O2 + and thus probably optically thick
 gas. This result also requires a very large ionization
 parameter and a relatively soft ionizing spectral energy
 distribution (e.g., a blackbody with T < 5 Ã— 104 K). Our
 observations can be explained as the echoing of a strong
 ultraviolet to soft X-ray flare caused by TDEs on molecular
 clouds in the inner parsecs of the galactic nuclei.
 Reanalyzing the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra reveals
 double-peaked or strongly blue-shouldered broad lines in
 three of the objects, which disappeared in the MMT spectra
 of two objects and faded by a factor of 10 in 8 yr in the
 remaining object with a decrease in both the line width and
 centroid offset. We interpret these broad lines as arising
 from decelerating biconical outflows. Our results
 demonstrate that the signatures of echoing can persist for
 as long as 10 yr and can be used to probe the gas
 environment in quiescent galactic nuclei.},

  Abstract                 = {The first-known tidal disruption event (TDE) with strong
 evidence for a relativistic jet -- based on extensive
 multi-wavelength campaigns -- is Swift J1644+5734. In order
 to directly measure the apparent speed of the radio jet, we
 performed very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)
 observations with the European VLBI network (EVN) at 5 GHz.
 Our observing strategy was to identify a very nearby and
 compact radio source with the real-time e-EVN, and then
 utilise this source as a stationary astrometry reference
 point in the later five deep EVN observations. With respect
 to the in-beam source FIRST J1644+5736, we have achieved a
 statistical astrometric precision about 12 micro-arcsecond
 (68 % confidence level) per epoch. This is one of the best
 phase-referencing measurements available to date. No proper
 motion has been detected in the Swift J1644+5734 radio
 ejecta. We conclude that the apparent average ejection
 speed between 2012.2 and 2015.2 was less than 0.3c with a
 confidence level of 99 %. This tight limit is direct
 observational evidence for either a very small viewing
 angle or a strong jet deceleration due to interactions with
 a dense circum-nuclear medium, in agreement with some
 recent theoretical studies.},

  Abstract                 = {We present results of a population synthesis study for
 semidetached short orbital period binaries which contain
 low-mass (âª…1.5 M&sun;) donors and massive (âª† 4 M&sun;)
 compact accretors, which in our model represent black
 holes. Evolution of these binaries is determined by nuclear
 evolution of the donors and/or orbital angular momentum
 loss due to magnetic braking by the stellar wind of the
 donors and gravitational wave radiation. According to our
 model the estimated total number of this type of black-hole
 binaries in the Galaxy is âª† 10 000. If the magnetic
 braking removing angular momentum in semidetached
 black-hole binaries is described by the Verbunt & Zwaan
 formula, the model predicts that among them around 3000
 systems with periods >2 h would be transient. In addition
 one finds several hundreds of luminous and stable systems
 with periods between 3 and 8 h. Several dozens of these
 bright systems should be observed above the RXTE ASM
 sensitivity limit. The absence of such systems implies that
 upon Roche-lobe overflow by the low-mass donor angular
 momentum losses are reduced by a factor more than 2 with
 respect to the Verbunt & Zwaan prescription. In such a case
 short period black-hole soft X-ray transients (SXT) may
 have donors that overflow the Roche lobe in the core
 hydrogen-burning stage. We show that it is unlikely that
 the transient behaviour of black-hole short-period X-ray
 binaries is explained by the evolved nature of the stellar
 companion. On the other hand a substantial fraction of
 black-hole binaries with periods >3 h could be faint with
 truncated, stable cold accretion discs as proposed by Menou
 et al. Most of the semidetached black-hole binaries are
 expected to have periods shorter than ~2 h. Properties of
 such, still to be observed, very small mass-ratio (q=M2/M1
 < 0.02) binaries are different from those of their longer
 period cousins.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent broad-band 34 and 44 GHz radio continuum observations of the Galactic center have revealed 41 massive stars identified with near-IR counterparts, as well as 44 proplyd candidates within 30" of Sgr A*. Radio observations obtained in 2011 and 2014 have been used to derive proper motions of eight young stars near Sgr A*. The accuracy of proper motion estimates based on near-IR observations by Lu et al. and Paumard et al. have been investigated by using their proper motions to predict the 2014 epoch positions of near-IR stars and comparing the predicted positions with those of radio counterparts in the 2014 radio observations. Predicted positions from Lu et al. show an rms scatter of 6 mas relative to the radio positions, while those from Paumard et al. show rms residuals of 20 mas, which is mainly due to uncertainties in the IR-based proper motions. Under the assumption of homogeneous ionized winds, we also determine the mass-loss rates of 11 radio stars, finding rates that are on average $\sim$2 times smaller than those determined from model atmosphere calculations and near-IR data. Clumpiness of ionized winds would reduce the mass loss rate of WR and O stars by additional factors of 3 and 10, respectively. One important implication of this is a reduction in the expected mass accretion rate onto Sgr A* from stellar winds by nearly an order of magnitude to a value of few$\times10^{-7}$ \msol\ yr$^{-1}$. Finally, we present the positions of 318 compact 34.5 GHz radio sources within 30\arcs\ of Sgr A*. At least 45 of these have stellar counterparts in the near-IR $K_s$ (2.18 $\mu$m) and $L'$ (3.8$\mu$m) bands.},

It turns out that the angular momentum of the ionized stellar winds from orbiting stars in one or two disks orbiting Sgr A* could be a critical factor in estimating accurately the accretion rate unto Sgr A*. A net angular momentum of ionized gas feeding Sgr A* could lower the Bondi rate. Furthermore, the recent time delay picture of the peak flare emission can be understood in the context of adiabatic expansion of hot plasma. The expansion speed of the plasma is estimated to be sub-relativistic. However, relativistic bulk motion of the plasma could lead to outflow from Sgr A*. Significant outflow from Sgr A* could then act as a feedback which could then reduce Bondi accretion rate. These uncertain factors can in part explain the underluminous nature of Sgr A*. The other issue is related to the emission mechanism and the cause of flare activity in different wavelength bands. The emission mechanism of flaring in the IR is now recognized to be due to synchrotron emission dominating the variable and quiescent emissions from Sgr A* in all wavelength bands with the possible exception of the X-ray emission. Modeling of X-ray and near-IR flares suggests that inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of IR flare photons by the energetic electrons responsible for the submm emission can account for for the X-ray flares. A time delay of minutes to tens of minutes is predicted between the peak flaring in the near-IR and X-rays, not due to adiabatic expansion of optically thick hot plasma, but to the time taken for IR flare photons to cross the accretion flow before being upscattered. Indeed, the observed X-ray fluxes and lack of detected time delays place significant restrictions on the electron density and temperature profile in the inner accretion flow. These constraints are tightened if the X-ray flares are instead produced by other mechanisms, such as synchrotron emission or the synchrotron self-Compton process as then the inverse Compton process can only provide a small fraction of the observed X-ray flare emission.},

  Abstract                 = {We present continued multi-frequency radio observations of
 the relativistic tidal disruption event Swift
 J164449.3+573451 (Sw 1644+57) extending to t â‰ˆ 600 days.
 The data were obtained with the JVLA and AMI Large Array as
 part of our on-going study of the jet energetics and the
 density structure of the parsec-scale environment around
 the disrupting supermassive black hole. We combine these
 data with public Swift/XRT and Chandra X-ray observations
 over the same time-frame to show that the jet has undergone
 a dramatic transition starting at â‰ˆ500 days, with a sharp
 decline in the X-ray flux by about a factor of 170 on a
 timescale of deltat/t <~ 0.2 (and by a factor of 15 in
 deltat/t â‰ˆ 0.05). The rapid decline rules out a forward
 shock origin (direct or reprocessing) for the X-ray
 emission at <~ 500 days, and instead points to internal
 dissipation in the inner jet. On the other hand, our radio
 data uniquely demonstrate that the low X-ray flux measured
 by Chandra at â‰ˆ610 days is consistent with emission from
 the forward shock. Furthermore, the Chandra data are
 inconsistent with thermal emission from the accretion disk
 itself since the expected temperature of ~30-60 eV and
 inner radius of ~2-10 Rs cannot accommodate the observed
 flux level or the detected emission at >~ 1 keV. We
 associate the rapid decline with a turn off of the
 relativistic jet when the mass accretion rate dropped below
 Ëœ\dot{M}_Edd â‰ˆ 0.006 M &sun; yr-1 (for a 3 Ã— 106 M
 &sun; black hole and order unity efficiency) indicating
 that the peak accretion rate was about 330 \dot{M}_Edd, and
 the total accreted mass by t â‰ˆ 500 days is about 0.15 M
 &sun;. From the radio data we further find significant
 flattening in the integrated energy of the forward shock at
 t >~ 250 days with E j, iso â‰ˆ 2 Ã— 1054 erg (Ej â‰ˆ 1052
 erg for a jet opening angle, theta j = 0.1) following a
 rise by about a factor of 15 at â‰ˆ30-250 days. Projecting
 forward, we predict that the emission in the radio and
 X-ray bands will evolve in tandem with similar decline
 rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Active galactic nuclei, which are powered by long-term
 accretion onto central supermassive black holes, produce
 relativistic jets with lifetimes of at least one million
 years, and the observation of the birth of such a jet is
 therefore unlikely. Transient accretion onto a supermassive
 black hole, for example through the tidal disruption of a
 stray star, thus offers a rare opportunity to study the
 birth of a relativistic jet. On 25 March 2011, an unusual
 transient source (Swift J164449.3+573451) was found,
 potentially representing such an accretion event. Here we
 report observations spanning centimetre to millimetre
 wavelengths and covering the first month of evolution of a
 luminous radio transient associated with Swift
 J164449.3+573451. The radio transient coincides with the
 nucleus of an inactive galaxy. We conclude that we are
 seeing a newly formed relativistic outflow, launched by
 transient accretion onto a million-solar-mass black hole. A
 relativistic outflow is not predicted in this situation,
 but we show that the tidal disruption of a star naturally
 explains the observed high-energy properties and radio
 luminosity and the inferred rate of such events. The weaker
 beaming in the radio-frequency spectrum relative to
 gamma-rays or X-rays suggests that radio searches may
 uncover similar events out to redshifts of z~6.},

  Abstract                 = {Direct multidimensional numerical simulation is the most reliable approach for calculating the fluid dynamics and observational signatures of relativistic jets in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We present a two-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulation of a GRB outflow during the afterglow phase, which uses the fifth-order weighted essentially nonoscillatory scheme and adaptive mesh refinement. Initially, the jet has a Lorentz factor of 20. We have followed its evolution up to 150 years. Using the hydrodynamic data, we calculate synchrotron radiation based upon standard afterglow models and compare our results with previous analytic work. We find that the sideways expansion of a relativistic GRB jet is a very slow process and previous analytic works have overestimated its rate. In our computed light curves, a very sharp jet break is seen and the postbreak light curves are steeper than analytic predictions. We find that the jet break in GRB afterglow light curves is mainly caused by the missing flux when the edge of the jet is observed. The outflow becomes nonrelativistic at the end of the Blandford-McKee phase. But it is still highly nonspherical, and it takes a rather long time for it to become a spherical Sedov-von Neumann-Taylor blast wave. We find that the late-time afterglows become increasingly flatter over time. But we disagree with the common notion that there is a sudden flattening in light curves due to the transition into the Sedov-von Neumann-Taylor solution. We have also found that there is a bump in light curves at very late times (~1000 days) due to radiation from the counter jet. We speculate that such a counter jet bump might have already been observed in GRB 980703.},

  Abstract                 = {In this second paper, in a series of two, we determine the
 properties of the stellar torus that we showed in the first
 paper to result as a product of two merging black holes. If
 the surrounding stellar cluster is as massive as the binary
 black hole, the torque acting on the stars ejects a
 fraction which extracts the binary's angular momentum.
 After the black holes coalesced on scales of \~{} 107ut
 \{yr\}, a geometrically thick torus remained. In the
 present article we show that a certain fraction of the
 stars has winds, shaped into elongated tails by the central
 radiation pressure, which are optically thick for line of
 sights aligned with them. These stars are sufficiently
 numerous to achieve a covering factor of 1, so that the
 complete torus is optically thick. This patchy structured
 torus is then compared with observations. We find the
 parameters of such a torus to be just in the right range in
 order to explain the observed large column densities in AGN
 and their temporal variations on time scales of about a
 decade. Within this model the broad absorption line quasars
 can be interpreted as quasars seen at intermediate
 inclination angles, with the line of sight grazing the edge
 of the torus. The half-opening angle of the torus is wider
 for major mergers and thus correlates with the central
 luminosity, as has been suggested previously. In this
 picture the spin of the merged black hole is possibly
 dominated by the orbital angular momentum of the binary.
 Thus the spin of the merged black hole points into a new
 direction, and consequently the jet experiences a spin-flip
 according to the spin-paradigm. This re-orientation could
 be an explanation for the X-shaped radio galaxies, and the
 advancing of a new jet through the ambient medium for
 Compact Symmetric Objects.},

  Abstract                 = {It is usually assumed that outflows from luminous active
 galactic nuclei (AGN) are either in the energy-conserving
 (non-radiative) or in the momentum-conserving (radiative)
 regime. We show that in a non-spherical geometry the
 effects of both regimes may manifest at the same time, and
 that it is the momentum of the outflow that sets the
 MBH-sigma relation. Considering an initially elliptical
 distribution of gas in the host galaxy, we show that a
 non-radiative outflow opens up a wide `escape route' over
 the paths of least resistance. Most of the outflow energy
 escapes in that direction. At the same time, in the
 directions of higher resistance, the ambient gas is
 affected mainly by the incident momentum from the outflow.
 Quenching SMBH growth requires quenching gas delivery along
 the paths of highest resistance, and therefore, it is the
 momentum of the outflow that limits the black hole growth.
 We present an analytical argument showing that such
 energy-conserving feedback bubbles driving leaky ambient
 shells will terminate SMBH growth once its mass reaches
 roughly the Msigma mass derived earlier by King for
 momentum-conserving AGN outflows. Our simulations also have
 potentially important implications for observations of AGN
 jet feedback and starburst galaxy feedback. The collimation
 of the wide angle AGN outflow away from the symmetry plane,
 as found in our simulations, indicates that credit for work
 done by such outflows may sometimes be mistakenly given to
 AGN jets or star formation feedback since wide angle v Ëœ
 0.1c outflows are harder to observe and the phase when they
 are present may be short.},

  abstract      = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) can arise from synchrotron maser emission at ultrarelativistic magnetized shocks, such as produced by flare ejecta from young magnetars. We combine particle-in-cell simulation results for the maser emission with the dynamics of self-similar shock deceleration, as commonly applied to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), to explore the implications for FRBs. The upstream environment is a mildly relativistic baryon-loaded shell released following a previous flare, motivated by the high electron-ion injection rate $\backslash$dot$\{$M$\}$ {\tilde} 10\^{}$\{$19$\}$-10\^{}$\{$21$\}$ g s$^{-1}$ needed to power the persistent radio nebula coincident with the repeating burster FRB 121102 and its high rotation measure. The radio fluence peaks once the optical depth ahead of the shock to induced Compton scattering {$\tau$}$_{c}$ {\lsim} 3. Given intervals between major ion ejection events {$\Delta$}T {\tilde} 10$^{5}$ s similar to the occurrence rate of the most powerful bursts from FRB 121102, we demonstrate the production of {\tilde}0.1-10 GHz FRBs with isotropic radiated energies {\tilde}10$^{37}$-10$^{40}$ erg and durations {\tilde}0.1-10 ms for flare energies E {\tilde} 10$^{43}$-10$^{45}$ erg. Deceleration of the blast wave, and increasing transparency of the upstream medium, generates temporal decay of the peak frequency, similar to the observed downward frequency drift seen in FRB 121102 and FRB 180814.J0422+73. The delay {$\Delta$}T {\gsim} 10$^{5 }$s between major ion-injection events needed to clear sufficiently low densities around the engine for FRB emission could explain prolonged `dark periods' and clustered burst arrival times. Thermal electrons heated at the shock generate a short-lived {\lsim}1 ms (1 s) synchrotron transient at gamma-ray (X-ray) energies, analogous to a scaled-down GRB afterglow.},

Using the integral-field spectrograph OSIRIS on Keck II behind the laser-guide-star adaptive optics system, this spectroscopic survey enables us to separate early-type (young, 4-6 Myr) and late-type (old, $\gt$1 Gyr) stars with a completeness of 50\% down to K' = 15.5 mag, which corresponds to \~{}10 Msun for the early-type stars. This work increases the radial extent of reported OSIRIS/Keck measurements by more than a factor of three from 4'' to 14'' (0.16 to 0.56 pc), along the projected disk of young stars. For our analysis, we implement a new method of completeness correction using a combination of star-planting simulations and Bayesian inference. We assign probabilities for the spectral type of every source detected in deep imaging down to K' = 15.5 mag using information from spectra, simulations, number counts, and the distribution of stars. The inferred radial surface-density profiles, {$\Sigma$}(R)vpropR $^{-\Gamma}$, for the young stars and late-type giants are consistent with earlier results ({$\Gamma$}$_{early}$ = 0.93 {\plusmn} 0.09, {$\Gamma$}$_{late}$ = 0.16 {\plusmn} 0.07). The late-type surface-density profile is approximately flat out to the edge of the survey. While the late-type stellar luminosity function is consistent with the Galactic bulge, the completeness-corrected luminosity function of the early-type stars has significantly more young stars at faint magnitudes compared with previous surveys with similar depth. This luminosity function indicates that the corresponding mass function of the young stars is likely less top-heavy than that inferred from previous surveys.},

This algorithmic regularization code, AR-CHAIN, can be used for the normal N-body problem, as well as for problems with softened potentials and/or with velocity-dependent external perturbations, including post-Newtonian terms, which we include up to order PN2.5. Arbitrarily extreme mass ratios are allowed. Only linear coordinate transformations are used and thus the algorithm is somewhat simpler than many earlier regularized schemes. We present the results of performance tests which suggest that the new code is either comparable in performance or superior to the existing regularization schemes based on the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel (KS) transformation. This is true even for the two-body problem, independent of eccentricity. An important advantage of the new method is that, contrary to the older KS-CHAIN code, zero masses are allowed. We use our algorithm to integrate the orbits of the S stars around the Milky Way supermassive black hole for one million years, including PN2.5 terms and an intermediate-mass black hole. The three S stars with shortest periods are observed to escape from the system after a few hundred thousand years.},

  abstract      = {Motivated by detections of hypervelocity stars that may originate from the Galactic center, we revisit the problem of a binary disruption by a passage near a much more massive point mass. The six orders of magnitude mass ratio between the Galactic center black hole (BH) and the binary stars allows us to formulate the problem in the restricted parabolic three-body approximation. In this framework, results can be simply rescaled in terms of binary masses, their initial separation, and the binary-to-black hole mass ratio. Consequently, an advantage over the full three-body calculation is that a much smaller set of simulations is needed to explore the relevant parameter space. Contrary to previous claims, we show that, upon binary disruption, the lighter star does not remain preferentially bound to the black hole. In fact, it is ejected in exactly 50\% of the cases. Nonetheless, lighter objects have higher ejection velocities, since the energy distribution is independent of mass. Focusing on the planar case, we provide the probability distributions for disruption of circular binaries and for the ejection energy. We show that even binaries that penetrate deeply into the tidal sphere of the BH are not doomed to disruption, but survive in 20\% of the cases. Nor do these deep encounters produce the highest ejection energies, which are instead obtained for binaries arriving to 0.1-0.5 of the tidal radius in a prograde orbit. Interestingly, such deep-reaching binaries separate widely after penetrating the tidal radius, but always approach each other again on their way out from the BH. Finally, our analytic method allows us to account for a finite size of the stars and recast the ejection energy in terms of a minimal possible separation. We find that, for a given minimal separation, the ejection energy is relatively insensitive to the initial binary separation.},

  abstract      = {We identify a new secular instability of eccentric stellar disks around supermassive black holes. We show that retrograde precession of the stellar orbits, due to the presence of a stellar cusp, induces coherent torques that amplify deviations of individual orbital eccentricities from the average, and thus drive all eccentricities away from their initial value. We investigate the instability using N-body simulations, and show that it can propel individual orbital eccentricities to significantly higher or lower values on the order of a precession timescale. This physics is relevant for the Galactic center, where massive stars are likely to form in eccentric disks around the SgrA* black hole. We show that the observed bimodal eccentricity distribution of disk stars in the Galactic center is in good agreement with the distribution resulting from the eccentricity instability and demonstrate how the dynamical evolution of such a disk results in several of its stars acquiring high (1 - e Lt 0.1) orbital eccentricity. Binary stars on such highly eccentric orbits would get tidally disrupted by the SgrA* black hole, possibly producing both S-stars near the black hole and high-velocity stars in the Galactic halo.},

  abstract      = {In nuclear star clusters, the potential is governed by the central massive black hole (MBH), so that stars move on nearly Keplerian orbits and the total potential is almost stationary in time. Yet, the deviations of the potential from the Keplerian one, due to the enclosed stellar mass and general relativity, will cause the stellar orbits to precess. Moreover, as a result of the finite number of stars, small deviations of the potential from spherical symmetry induce residual torques that can change the stars{\rsquo} angular momentum faster than the standard two-body relaxation. The combination of these two effects drives a stochastic evolution of orbital angular momentum, a process named {\ldquo}resonant relaxation{\rdquo} (RR). Owing to recent developments in the description of the relaxation of self-gravitating systems, we can now fully describe scalar resonant relaxation (relaxation of the magnitude of the angular momentum) as a diffusion process. In this framework, the potential fluctuations due to the complex orbital motion of the stars are described by a random correlated noise with statistical properties that are fully characterized by the stars{\rsquo} mean field motion. On long timescales, the cluster can be regarded as a diffusive system with diffusion coefficients that depend explicitly on the mean field stellar distribution through the properties of the noise. We show here, for the first time, how the diffusion coefficients of scalar RR, for a spherically symmetric system, can be fully calculated from first principles, without any free parameters. We also provide an open source code that evaluates these diffusion coefficients numerically.},

  abstract      = {The orbits of stars close to a massive black hole (MBH) are nearly Keplerian ellipses. Such orbits exert long-term torques on each other, which lead to an enhanced angular momentum relaxation known as resonant relaxation. Under certain conditions, this process can modify the angular momentum distribution and affect the interaction rates of the stars with the MBH more efficiently than non-resonant relaxation. The torque on an orbit exerted by the cluster depends on the eccentricity of the orbit. In this paper, we calculate this dependence and determine the resonant relaxation time-scale as a function of eccentricity. In particular, we show that the component of the torque that changes the magnitude of the angular momentum is linearly proportional to eccentricity, so resonant relaxation is much more efficient on eccentric orbits than on circular orbits.},

  abstract      = {The tidal force from a supermassive black hole can rip apart a star that passes close enough in what is known as a Tidal Disruption Event (TDE). Typically, half of the destroyed star remains bound to the black hole and falls back on highly eccentric orbits, forming an accretion flow that powers a luminous flare. In this paper, we use analytical and numerical calculations to explore the effect of stellar rotation on the fallback rate of material. We find that slowly spinning stars ({$\Omega$}$_{*}$ {\lsim} 0.01{$\Omega$}$_{breakup}$) provide only a small perturbation to fallback rates found in the non-spinning case. However, when the star spins faster, there can be significant effects. If the star is spinning retrograde with respect to its orbit, the tidal force from the black hole has to spin down the star first before disrupting it, causing delayed and sometimes only partial disruption events. However, if the star is spinning prograde, this works with the tidal force and the material falls back sooner and with a higher peak rate. We examine the power-law index of the fallback curves, finding that in all cases the fallback rate overshoots the canonical t $^{-5/3}$ rate briefly after the peak, with the depth of the overshoot dependent on the stellar spin. We also find that, in general, the late time evolution is slightly flatter than the canonical t $^{-5/3}$ rate. We therefore conclude that considering the spin of the star may be important in modeling observed TDE light curves.},

It is surmised that, if dust absorption generates the asymmetric nuclear morphology observed, the dust grain size must either be exceptionally large, or the dust optical depth must be extremely high; the higher surface-brightness and off-center nuclear component may alternatively be a separate stellar system.},

  abstract      = {We study the dynamical evolution of a stellar disc orbiting a massive black hole. We explore the role of two-body relaxation, mass segregation, stellar evolution and binary-heating in affecting the disc evolution and consider the impact of the nuclear cluster properties and the stellar-disc mass-function. We use analytic arguments and apply them to study the evolution of a the velocity dispersion of stars in a Galatic Centre (GC) - like stellar disc on both short (few million years) and longer (100 Myr) evolutionary time-scales. The dominant processes affecting the disc evolution are two-body relaxation and mass-stratification, where the massive stars play a key role in kinematically heating lower mass stars; binary-heating has only a little contribution. In particular, models with realistic mass-functions show the disc structure to be mass-stratified. The number of massive stars in the disc decrease due to stellar evolution, consequently leading to slower relaxation. At these later evolutionary stages, dynamical heating by the nuclear cluster plays a progressively more important role. Given these findings, it is likely that two-body relaxation alone could not produce the observed configuration of the stellar disc in the GC and other collective processes might have played an important role. Such processes are less likely to produce mass-stratification in the disc and therefore a detailed study of the mass-stratification of the GC disc may provide a handle on the processes that dominate its evolution. Finally, two-body relaxation would leave a stellar disc in a relatively thin configuration even after 100 Myr and therefore earlier discs, now containing only older, lower mass stars, might still be observed in the GC, unless destroyed/smeared by other processes.},
