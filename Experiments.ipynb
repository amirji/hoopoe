Encountered: Map{concluding remarks -> Map{text -> String(\"\n% ===============\n\\label{sec:conclusion}\nWe examine in this paper the concentration properties of large dust\ngrains in protoplanetary transition discs characterised by a lopsided\ncrescent-shaped distribution in the gas surface density. 2D\nhydrodynamical simulations have been carried out including both gas\nand dust, with dust modelled as test particles undergoing gas drag\n(Epstein regime). The lopsided distribution in the gas is obtained by\nadopting a ring-like gas density profile that becomes unstable against\nthe Rossby-wave instability.  The instability saturates into a\nlarge-scale vortex that efficiently traps the grains. This trapping\nmechanism is often invoked to interpret the crescent-shaped continuum\nemission imaged by sub-millimetre interferometers in some transition\ndiscs \\citep[e.g.,][]{Regaly12}.\n\nIn accompanying Paper I (Zhu \\& Baruteau, submitted) we explore the\nrole of gas self-gravity and of the disc mass in shaping the vortex\nstructure.  Their impact on the trapping of dust grains is the scope\nof the present paper. We first present results of models without gas\nself-gravity, for which we find that the indirect force resulting from\nthe displacement of the star by the vortex plays a prominent role in\nthe gas and dust dynamics, in agreement with \\cite{MC15}.  While\ngrains with Stokes number (stopping time to orbital time ratio, St)\nmuch smaller and much larger than unity are trapped near the vortex\ncentre, particles with St $\\sim 1$ are shifted ahead of the vortex in\nthe azimuthal direction. This is in good qualitative agreement with\nthe results of test particle integrations by \\cite{MC15}.  We find\nparticle shift angles relative to the vortex centre that go up to\n20-25 degrees for St $\\sim 2-4$ particles, depending on the disc mass,\nwhich strongly affects the shape and orbital evolution of the vortex.\nOur maximum shift angles are a factor $\\sim 2$ smaller than in\n\\cite{MC15}.\n\nWe then present results with gas self-gravity, and find that it\nlargely affects dust trapping in the vortex. At low to moderate gas\nsurface densities at the vortex's radial location (local Toomre\nparameter $\\gtrsim 10$), we find gas self-gravity to be most important\nfor large grains. Grains with St $\\lesssim 1$ (typically smaller than\n1 cm) have similar shift angles with and without self-gravity, as gas\ndrag plays a major role in determining the dynamics of small\nparticles.  The dynamics of larger particles (St $\\gtrsim 1$) becomes\nincreasingly dominated by gas self-gravity, and we find that shift\nangles increase very rapidly with increasing grain size\n(Figure~\\ref{fig:depth}). We find shift angles of about 50 degrees for\ngrains of 3-5 cm in size, and up to 90 degrees for $\\sim$ 10 cm\ngrains.  We show that these large shift angles result from the large\nparticles undergoing horseshoe U-turns relative to the vortex before\ndrifting to their equilibrium location via gas drag. The horseshoe\nU-turns arise because of the self-gravitating acceleration of the gas\nexerted on the particles, which therefore interact with the vortex as\nif it was a massive body. The limit case of fully decoupled particles\nactually shares a number of analogies with the evolution of inviscid\ngas near a low-mass planet. Synthetic images produced from our\nsimulations show that the size segregation caused by self-gravity\nbetween the smallest and largest grains at the vortex's radial\nlocation could cause a double peak in the dust's continuum emission,\ndepending on the dust's size distribution. The same size segregation,\nwhich does not mix the smallest and largest grains at the vortex\ncentre, could have interesting consequences on core growth inside the\nvortex, and on dust feedback onto the gas.\n\nAt large gas surface densities at the vortex's radial location (local\nToomre parameter $\\lesssim 10$), self-gravity renders the vortex's\npattern frequency slower than the Keplerian frequency.  This shifts\nthe vortex's corotation radius outside the radial location where the\nlopsided gas density distribution is maximum. Consequently, (most of)\nthe smallest particles concentrate in point-like distributions that\nare shifted slightly outside the gas density maximum. Conversely,\nlarger particles (St $\\gtrsim 0.1$) describe ring-like structures,\nsome of them lopsided, which are centred about the radial location\nwhere the gas density peaks (Figures~\\ref{fig:g1_rf2}\nand~\\ref{fig:g10_rf2}).\n\nOur study highlights that the concentration of large dust grains is\nsensitive to the shape of the vortex, which depends on the gas model.\nThe main result of Paper I is that self-gravity plays a prominent role\nin structuring the vortex in massive discs. The main result of the\npresent paper is that self-gravity plays a prominent role in setting\nparticle concentration within the vortex even at low disc masses.\n\nThere are several ways that the physical model used in this work can\nbe improved. Inclusion of an energy equation for the gas, of the\ndisc's vertical stratification (via 3D simulations), and of possibly\nimportant feedback effects of dust concentration onto the gas are some\nof them. Another outstanding question is that of the particles\nconcentration in a vortex formed at the outer edge of a gap-opening\nplanet, which could be significantly impacted by the planet wakes.\nMore generally, a pressing, yet unsolved issue is that of the\nexcitation and long-term maintenance of a large-scale vortex through\nthe RWI. In this work, we have assumed a narrow ring-like density\nprofile for the (nearly inviscid) gas plus an ad hoc $m=1$ seed\nperturbation; however, there is no robust way to generate\neither. Non-axisymmetric seed perturbations could be\ninduced by disc turbulence, embedded planet companions or nearby\nstars. Several mechanisms mentioned in the third-to-last paragraph in\nthe introduction could provide the necessary axisymmetric density\n(vortensity) extremum, like for instance an effective viscosity jump\nat the transition between magnetically active and inactive\nregions. But, again, more work is needed to assess whether these\nmechanisms, and the vortices that they trigger, have a long lifetime.\n\n% AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\\appendix\n% AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\n% ===============\n\"), citations -> List{List{String(\"Regaly12\")}, List{}, List{}}}, synthetic dust continuum observations -> Map{text -> String(\"\n% ===============\n\\label{sec:synthetic}\n\nIn this section, we use the dust distribution in our simulations of\nself-gravitating lopsided discs to produce synthetic images of dust\ncontinuum observations. We focus on the models where the gas surface\ndensity at the vortex location is lower or equal than in model g2, for\nwhich, using the physical units of Section~\\ref{sec:codeunits}, grains\nup to few centimetres in size have nearly stationary point-like\ndistributions around the vortex's radial location. (In contrast, in\nmodels with larger gas densities like models g5 and g10, grains larger\nthan about 1 cm have non-axisymmetric ring-like distributions with\nnon-trivial dependence on grain size, and are non-stationary in a\nframe rotating at the vortex's frequency, which makes it more delicate\nto predict the corresponding dust continuum emission). Particle shift\nangles relative to the vortex centre are displayed in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:depth} for models g0p2, g0p5 and g2 at 500 orbits\nafter the beginning of the simulations (250 orbits after introduction\nof the particles). For each model, particles larger than the largest\nsize shown in the figure describe ring-like structures centred around\nthe vortex's radial location.\n\nTo translate the dust distribution in our simulations into dust\nsurface density, we assume that dust grains have a size distribution\n$n(s) \\propto s^{-p}$ from 30 $\\mu$m to 20 cm. The value of $p$ is\nvery uncertain, especially in the context of dust trapping in a\nvortex, and we allow it to vary from 3 to 2.5. We divide the above\nsize range into small size bins with a logarithmic spacing. We assume\nthat grains smaller than 0.5 mm follow the gas distribution, and that\nlarger grains have point-like distributions shifted ahead of the\nvortex. Particles are assigned shift angles ($\\delta\\varphi$) through\nfits of the results of simulations shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:depth}.\nFor model g2, we find good agreement with $\\delta\\varphi(s) =\n90^{\\circ} \\times 0.5 \\{1 + \\tanh(2.6 \\log_{10}(14s))\\}$ with $s$ in\nmetres (see the black dashed curve in Figure~\\ref{fig:depth}).  For\nmodel g0p5, we use $\\delta\\varphi(s) = 80^{\\circ}\\times 0.5 \\{1 +\n\\tanh(2.3 \\log_{10}(18s))\\}$ (blue dashed curve in the figure), and\nfor model g0p2, $\\delta\\varphi(s) = 70^{\\circ} \\times 0.5 \\{1 +\n\\tanh(2 \\log_{10}(33s))\\}$ (red dashed curve). The dust's surface\ndensity in each size bin is then derived assuming a total dust-to-gas\nmass ratio of 1\\%, and converting our results of simulations into\nphysical units using the set of units in Section~\\ref{sec:codeunits}.\n\nWe use Mie theory to determine the dust opacity in each size bin at a\nwavelength of 8 mm (37.5 GHz). See \\cite{ZhuStone14} for more details\n(their section 4.3). The dust opacities per unit dust mass at 8 mm are\n$1.2\\times10^{-3}$, $1.7\\times10^{-3}$, $1.4\\times10^{-2}$, 0.79,\n0.67, 0.15, $5.2\\times10^{-2}$ and $1.0\\times10^{-2}$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$\nfor grains of radius 30 $\\mu$m, 100 $\\mu$m, 300 $\\mu$m, 1 mm, 3 mm, 1\ncm, 3 cm and 20 cm. We finally multiply the dust's surface density in\neach size bin with the interpolated opacity and add these products\ntogether to get the disc's optical depth. Synthetic images are\nproduced by convolving the disc's optical depth with a Gaussian kernel\nof FWHM equal to 0.05\" or 0.2\". The disc is assumed to be located at\n140 parsecs and to be seen face-on.\n\nSynthetic images are displayed in Figure~\\ref{fig:synthetic} for\nmodels g0p2 (upper panels) and g2 (lower panels). Values of $p$ (minus\nthe power-law index of the dust size distribution), and of the FWHM of\nthe Gaussian kernel by which the total optical depth is convolved, are\nindicated in the top-left corner in the panels. These images show\nthat, for steep size distributions ($p \\geq 3$), the dust continuum\nemission at 8 mm displays a lopsided distribution with a peak emission\nat the vortex centre (where the gas surface density is maximum). For\nshallower size distributions ($p \\lesssim 2.5-3$), however, the dust\ncontinuum emission at 8 mm features a double-peaked distribution, with\none peak at the vortex centre, and a second peak shifted ahead of the\nvortex centre in the azimuthal direction, which corresponds to the\nemission of grains of a few centimetres in size.  The azimuthal shift\nof the second peak depends on the azimuthally-averaged surface density\nof the gas at the vortex's radial location, $\\langle\\Sigma_{\\rm\n  V}\\rangle$ (Figure~\\ref{fig:depth}). It is about 70 degrees in model\ng0p2, where $\\langle\\Sigma_{\\rm V}\\rangle \\approx 0.5$ g cm$^{-2}$ at\n$\\approx 50$ AU, and goes up to nearly 90 degrees in model g2, where\n$\\langle\\Sigma_{\\rm V}\\rangle \\approx 5$ g cm$^{-2}$ at $\\approx 60$\nAU.\n\nSuch double peak continuum emissions, if observed at mm/cm wavelengths\nlike with ALMA or the VLA, could reveal the size segregation due to\ngas self-gravity between small and large dust grains trapped in a\ncrescent-shaped vortex. There is so far no clear evidence for double\npeak emissions similar to what our dusty horseshoe model predicts. The\ndouble peak emission observed with ALMA in the HD 142527 disc is most\nprobably caused by shadows cast by the tilted inner disc over the\nlopsided outer disc \\citep{Casassus15,Marino15shadows}. VLA (0.9 cm)\nand ALMA Band 7 (0.8 mm) continuum emissions of the MWC 758 disc show\ntwo intensity peaks located to the north-west and to the south of the\nstar \\citep{Marino15MWC758}. These authors show that two dust-trapping\nvortices could account for the double peak continuum emissions, and\nthe fact the VLA emission is more compact than the ALMA emission. In\ntheir model, the vortex to the south would be slightly closer to the\nstar (at $\\sim 90$ AU) than the one to the north-west (at $\\sim 120$\nAU). It would be interesting to check whether our dusty horseshoe\nmodel, which comprises a single vortex, could also reproduce the\ndouble peak distribution in the MWC 758 disc. The large-scale spirals\nobserved in near-IR \\citep{Benisty15} could greatly complicate the\ndust concentration properties, whatever the number of dust-trapping\nvortices to reproduce the double peak continuum emission at mm/cm\nwavelengths. We also stress that in the synthetic sub-mm images of\n\\cite{Regaly12}, a single elongated vortex in the gas disc can produce\neither one or two peaks of emission due to beam dilution effects\n(especially when angular resolution is moderate and the beam is highly\nelongated; Zs.

The gas model is detailed in Paper I and briefly\nrecalled in Section~\\ref{sec:model_gas}. For this work, a particle\nintegrator has been implemented in FARGO-ADSG for the dust. The dust\nmodel is described in Section~\\ref{sec:model_pc}. Conversion of our\nresults of simulations from code units to physical units follows in\nSection~\\ref{sec:codeunits}.\n\n% --------------------------\n\\subsection{Gas}\n% --------------------------\n\\label{sec:model_gas}\nThe gas model and the initial conditions of the simulations are chosen\nto generate a long-lived elongated vortex through the\nRWI. Specifically, the initial surface density of the gas has a\n(modified) Gaussian radial profile of the form\n%\n\\begin{multline}\n  \\Sigma(r,\\varphi) = \\Sigma_0 \\left[10^{-2}\n    + \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{(r-r_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right\\}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\\n  \\times\\left[\n    1+10^{-3}\\times\\cos\\varphi\\times\\sin\\left(\\pi\\frac{r-r_{\\rm\n          in}}{r_{\\rm out}-r_{\\rm in}}\\right) \\right],\n          \\label{eq:Sigma0}\n\\end{multline}\n%\nwhere $\\Sigma_0$ is a free parameter that varies the disc mass, $r_0$\nis a reference radius that defines the code's unit of length, $\\sigma\n= 2H(r_0)$ with $H=c_{\\rm s} / \\Omega_{\\rm K}$ the disc's pressure\nscale height, $c_{\\rm s}$ the sound speed and $\\Omega_{\\rm K}$ the\nKeplerian angular frequency. We take $H$ equal to $0.1r$ and constant\nin time (the disc is assumed to be isothermal). The second bracket in\nthe above equation corresponds to a small perturbation of azimuthal\nwavenumber $m=1$ applied smoothly between the grid's inner edge\n($r_{\\rm in} = 0.2r_0$) and outer edge ($r_{\\rm out} = 2r_0$).\n\nThe gas disc that we simulate is therefore a narrow ring of gas rather\nthan an extended outer disc beyond a cavity, as is observed in\ntransition discs. This is mainly for numerical convenience, as it\nallows us to reduce the radial extent of the computational grid that\nsimulates the disc, and to focus on the dynamics of the gas and dust\nnear the vortex. In particular, the low densities at the disc edges\nminimize edge effects in the direct and indirect contributions to the\ndisc's gravitational potential \\citep{HPS92,Adams89}.\n\nThe simulations presented in this paper are summarised in\nTable~\\ref{tab:models}. In the simulations with gas self-gravity, the\ndisc gravitationally accelerates itself and the star, while in the\nsimulations without self-gravity, the disc only accelerates the\nstar. In all the simulations, the star remains at the origin of the\nreference frame, and the indirect terms that account for the\nacceleration of the star by the disc are therefore included in the\nequations of motion, regardless of whether self-gravity is included or\nnot. Our median value $\\Sigma_0 = 5\\times 10^{-3}$ corresponds to an\ninitial disc-to-star mass ratio of 1.7\\%. The Toomre parameter, $Q\n\\approx c_{\\rm s}\\Omega / \\pi G \\Sigma$, with $\\Omega$ the disc's\nangular frequency and $G$ the gravitational constant, is initially\nequal to 13, 5 and 2.5 at $r=r_0$ in models g2, g5 and g10,\nrespectively.\n% TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\n\\begin{table}\n  \\centering\n  \\caption{\\label{tab:models}Simulation models}\n  \\smallskip\n  \\begin{minipage}{\\hsize}\n    \\centering\n    \\begin{tabular}{l c r}\n      Name & Gas self-gravity & $\\Sigma_0$ [code units]\\\\\n      \\hline\n      \\hline\n      g0p2 & Yes & $0.2\\times10^{-3}$\\\\\n      g0p5 & Yes & $0.5\\times10^{-3}$\\\\\n      g2n & No & $2\\times10^{-3}$\\\\\n      g2 & Yes & $2\\times10^{-3}$\\\\\n      g5n & No & $5\\times10^{-3}$\\\\\n      g5 & Yes & $5\\times10^{-3}$\\\\\n      g10n & No & $10\\times 10^{-3}$\\\\\n      g10 & Yes & $10\\times10^{-3}$\\\\\n      \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\\par\n  \\end{minipage}\n\\end{table}\n% TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\n\nA small turbulent viscosity is included in the\nsimulations. Preliminary runs have shown that a constant alpha viscous\nparameter $\\alpha = 10^{-6}$ is a good compromise between a strong,\nlong-lived vortex \\citep[which requires low viscosities, particularly\nwith gas self-gravity as it inhibits the RWI;][]{GN88} and convergence\nwith increasing grid resolution (which would favour large\nviscosities).\n\nThe hydrodynamical equations are solved on a polar grid with $N_{\\rm\n  r} = 300$ cells logarithmically spaced between $r_{\\rm in}$ and\n$r_{\\rm out}$, and $N_{\\rm s} = 600$ sectors evenly spaced between\n$\\varphi=0$ and $2\\pi$. This grid resolution is sufficient for our\npurposes and helps maintain a tractable computational cost when\nincluding many dust particles.  Although the logarithmic radial\nspacing is only required for the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm in\nthe calculation of the gas self-gravity \\citep{BM08b}, it is also used\nwithout self-gravity to keep the same grid resolution in all\nsimulations. When self-gravity is included, a softening length\n$\\varepsilon = 0.3H(r)$ is used in the self-gravitating potential to\nmimic the effect of a finite vertical thickness. Standard outflow\n(zero-gradient) boundary conditions are used in the simulations.\n\n\n% --------------------------\n\\subsection{Dust}\n% --------------------------\n\\label{sec:model_pc}\nDust is modelled by Lagrangian particles that feel the star's gravity\n(direct and indirect acceleration terms), gas drag, but that do not\ninteract together (no dust self-gravity, no collisions nor growth). An\nimportant point is that when gas self-gravity is included, the\nparticles also feel the self-gravitating acceleration of the gas. It\nimplies that differences in the gas and dust velocities are only\nimparted by the pressure force felt by the gas.  We discard possibly\nimportant effects of dust feedback onto the gas\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{CZS15}.\n\nThe dust particles that we simulate are much smaller than the\nmolecular mean-free path in our disc models (see\nSection~\\ref{sec:codeunits}).  The drag force exerted by the gas\ntherefore corresponds to the so-called Epstein regime, and the\nparticles Stokes number (St), which is a dimensionless measure of the\nparticles stopping time (${\\tau_{\\rm s}} = {\\rm St}\\,\\Omega^{-1}$), is\ngiven by\n%\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\rm St} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{s \\rho_{\\rm pc}}{f_{\\rm D}\\Sigma_{\\rm gas}} \n\\approx \\frac{0.015}{f_{\\rm D}} \\times \n\\left(\\frac{s}{1{\\rm mm}}\\right)\n\\left(\\frac{\\rho_{\\rm pc}}{1{\\rm g\\;cm}^{-3}}\\right)\n\\left(\\frac{10{\\rm g\\;cm}^{-2}}{\\Sigma_{\\rm gas}}\\right)\n\\label{eq:St}\n\\end{equation}\n%\nwith $s$ the physical radius of the particles, $\\rho_{\\rm pc}$ their\ninternal mass density (we choose $\\rho_{\\rm pc} = 1$ g cm$^{-3}$),\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm gas}$ the gas surface density at the particles location,\nand $f_{\\rm D} = \\sqrt{1 + 9\\pi{\\cal M}^2/128}$ is a dimensionless\ncoefficient that features the Mach number of the dust relative to the\ngas, ${\\cal M} = |{\\bf v} - {\\bf v_{\\rm gas}}|/c_{\\rm s}$\n\\citep[][${\\bf v}$ and ${\\bf v_{\\rm gas}}$ denote the velocity vector\nof the dust and gas, respectively]{SJP07}. In practice $f_{\\rm D}\n\\approx 1$ in our simulations. We consider several particle sizes that\nare fixed in the simulations. Thus, the particles Stokes number does\nvary in the simulations according to the gas surface density at the\nparticles location. Stokes numbers typically range from\n$\\sim$$10^{-2}$ to $\\sim$$40$, which allows us to probe different\ntrapping efficiencies via gas drag.\n\nWe use 10,000 particles to simulate dust grains of a given size. Their\ninitial distribution is uniform between $r=0.8r_0$ and $1.2r_0$,\nunless otherwise stated. Their initial velocities are Keplerian,\nexcept in simulations with gas self-gravity, for which the initial\nazimuthal velocity of the particles includes the gas self-gravitating\nradial acceleration \\citep[much like in disc-planet simulations with\nself-gravity, see][]{BM08b}.  The number of dust particles may seem\nrather small but, as we will see in Section~\\ref{sec:results}, dust\nparticles quickly concentrate at well-defined locations in the disc,\neither at a single point inside or near the vortex, or along a ring\naround the vortex's radial location. We find 10,000 particles to be\nenough to describe the dust's azimuthal density distribution when it\nforms ring-like structures around the vortex's radial location.\n\nThe equations of motion for the dust particles are solved with a\nleapfrog integrator in polar coordinates. The integrator basically\ncorresponds to the 2D leapfrog integrator in cylindrical coordinates\nimplemented by \\cite{Zhu14} in the code ATHENA. We carried out the\nvarious tests described in the Appendix of \\cite{Zhu14} to validate\nour particle integrator. The particle integration scheme is\nparallelized with MPI using FARGO's domain decomposition into rings.\nThe timestep used in the integration of the dust particles is\nidentical to that used in the gas equations, it is therefore\nconstrained by the Courant-Frederichs-Levy (CFL) condition specific to\nFARGO. Test simulations using a fixed timestep, chosen to be shorter\nthan the minimum stopping time of the particles, showed negligible\nchanges to our results. In practice, the effective time step in our\nsimulations is shorter than the particles stopping time.\n\n\n% -------------------------- \n\\subsection{Conversion from code to physical units}\n% --------------------------\n\\label{sec:codeunits}\nAs mentioned in Section~\\ref{sec:model_gas}, the radial location $r_0$\nwhere the initial gas surface density is maximum defines the code's\nunit of length. The unit of mass is the mass of the central star, and\nthe unit of time is the Keplerian orbital period at $r=r_0$ divided by\n$2\\pi$. Whenever time is expressed in orbits, it refers to the orbital\nperiod at $r=r_0$, which we denote by $T_{\\rm orb}$.\n\nTo keep our results as general as possible, we do not specify physical\nunits of length and mass in the simulations, since the gas and dust\ndynamics are set by dimensionless numbers like the Toomre parameter,\nthe disc-to-star mass ratio or the particles Stokes number. All our\nresults are thus shown in code units, but it is very easy to convert\nthem into physical units. Assuming the mass unit is the Sun's mass and\nthe length unit is 65 AU, our median value for $\\Sigma_0$ of $5\\times\n10^{-3}$ corresponds to $\\approx$10 g cm$^{-2}$ and $T_{\\rm orb}\\sim$\n500 yrs.  For comparison, the gas surface density at the edge of the\n$\\sim$$70$ AU cavity in the J1604-2130 disc is estimated as $\\sim$10 g\ncm$^{-2}$, and that at the edge of the $\\sim$$45$ AU cavity in the\nLkCa 15 disc is $\\sim$60 g cm$^{-2}$ \\citep{vanderMarel2015}.\nConversion from Stokes number to dust size is via Eq.~(\\ref{eq:St}),\nusing $f_{\\rm D} = 1$. If, for example, dust grains have an internal\ndensity of 1 g cm$^{-3}$, and that the gas surface density at their\nlocation is 10 g cm$^{-2}$ (5$\\times 10^{-3}$ in code units), then St\n$=1$ particles correspond to $\\approx$ 6 cm grains. Using the same\nunits, the largest particles that we have simulated are a few metres\nin size, which remains much smaller than the minimum molecular mean\nfree path in our disc models ($\\sim$ 300 metres in models g10 and\ng10n) and justifies that the dust grains that we simulate are in the\nEpstein regime.\n\n\n% ===============\n\"), citations -> List{List{String(\"fargo1\")}, List{String(\"BM08a\"), String(\"\n  BM08b\")}, List{String(\"HPS92\"), String(\"Adams89\")}, List{String(\"GN88\")}, List{String(\"BM08b\")}, List{String(\"CZS15\")}, List{String(\"\\bf v\")}, List{String(\"BM08b\")}, List{String(\"vanderMarel2015\")}, List{}, List{}}}, convergence with grid resolution -> Map{text -> String(\"\n% ===============\n\\label{sec:conv}\nWe have carried out tests of convergence with increasing grid\nresolution for the non self-gravitating models g2n and g5n. Each model\nwas simulated with the same particle size, and with the number of grid\ncells in the radial times azimuthal directions increased from $200\n\\times 400$ to $500 \\times 1000$ for model g2n, and up to $600 \\times\n1200$ for model g5n. Results are displayed in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:conv}. For model g2n (upper panels) convergence in\nresolution is fairly good, with the particles shift angle and Stokes\nnumber varying by less than 10\\% between our nominal resolution\n($300\\times 600$) and maximum resolution. This fairly good convergence\nis not surprising since our gas model aims at producing a large-scale\nlopsided distribution in the gas surface density ($m=1$\nmode). Convergence is not excellent either. It is due to the fact that\nvortex inward migration occurs at a pace that slightly increases with\nincreasing resolution. Visual inspection at the gas density at\ndifferent resolutions points to a larger density contrast of the\nvortex waves with increasing resolution, which relates to a larger\nangular momentum flux extracted from the vortex and carried away by\nthe waves, and therefore faster inward migration (note again the\nanalogy with planetary migration). Increasing resolution therefore\ntends to strengthen the vortex and increase the gas density inside the\nvortex, which causes the particles Stokes number to slightly decrease,\nexplaining our results. This behaviour is also apparent in model g5n\nup to about 300 orbits, after which discrepancies with varying\nresolution are found to increase, due to the proximity of the vortex\nto the inner edge of the computational domain and the resulting\npartial reflection of waves at that location. Apart from when the\nvortex gets too close to the grid's inner edge, convergence with grid\nresolution is satisfactory and our results show that the moderate grid\nresolution adopted throughout this work is sufficient for our\npurposes.

The vortex's migration\nresults from an asymmetric wave emission by the vortex \\citep{PLP10}. \nVortex migration is therefore due to pressure\n  torques, not to gravitational torques, at least in the absence of\n  gas self-gravity. The waves emitted by the vortex cannot be seen in\nthe panels of Figure~\\ref{fig:g1n} because their density contrast\nrelative to the background disc is smaller than the vortex's, and\nbecause the radial profile of the gas density drops rapidly away from\nthe vortex's radial location. The wave that propagates inward from the\nvortex's radial location carries a negative flux of angular momentum\nand thus exerts a positive torque on the vortex. Conversely, the wave\nthat propagates outward from the vortex's radial location carries a\npositive flux of angular momentum and exerts a negative torque on the\nvortex.  In the absence of gas self-gravity, geometrical effects and\nthe radial gradient of surface density favour the outer wave, and the\nnet exchange of angular momentum between the vortex and the disc leads\nto inward migration of the vortex \\citep{PLP10}. We also notice that\nthe vortex strengthens during its inward migration with both the\nsurface density at the vortex centre and the azimuthal contrast in\nsurface density along the vortex increasing over time. At 300 orbits,\nthe surface density contrasts along the vortex are by factors of\nroughly 2.5, 12 and 25 in models g2n, g5n and g10n, respectively.\n\nThe location of the particles is marked by filled circles in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:g1n}, with different colours used for different\nparticle sizes. Recall that in the simulations the size of the\nparticles is fixed, but their Stokes number evolves with time\naccording to the gas surface density at the particles location (see\nEq.~\\ref{eq:St}).  The Stokes numbers shown in the lower-left corner\nin the panels are those at the particles location at 300 orbits. Since\ninitial Stokes numbers range from about 0.01 to 30, particles are\nquickly trapped inside the vortex as a result of gas drag. They\neventually concentrate at specific locations inside the vortex where a\nforce balance is reached between gas drag, the centrifugal force and\nthe star's gravity (direct and indirect terms; force balance is meant\nto be in the non-rotating frame centred onto the star). We find\nqualitatively the same trend as in \\cite{MC15}: while particles with\nSt $\\ll 1$ and $\\gg 1$ are trapped towards the vortex centre,\nparticles with St $\\sim 1$ are shifted ahead of the vortex centre in\nthe azimuthal direction. The orientations and relative amplitudes of\nthe aforementioned forces implies that the force balance for St $\\sim\n1$ particles is reached ahead of the vortex and not behind it\n\\citep[see the lower-right panel in figure 3 of][]{MC15}. We quantify\nthe azimuthal offset of the particles with respect to the vortex by\nmeasuring the azimuth of the particles relative to the location in the\nvortex where the gas surface density peaks. We call it the shift angle\nof a particle. At 300 orbits, the largest shift angles are about 20\ndegrees in model g2n for St $\\sim 4$, 23 degrees in model g5n for St\n$\\sim 2$, and 13 degrees in model g10n for St $\\sim 2$. Although quite\nsignificant, our maximum shift angles are smaller than in \\cite{MC15},\nwho found that St$=0.5$ particles could be shifted by as much as 45\ndegrees.  Comparison between our models, and with \\cite{MC15}, shows\nthat shift angles do not depend solely on the particles Stokes number\nbut also on the velocity differences between gas and dust, which are\nintimately related to the shape and strength of the vortex. We point\nout that the smallest shift angles are obtained in model g10n, which\nis the one that maximises the indirect term in the star acceleration\nby having the most massive, asymmetric and closest vortex. We also\nnote a tiny shift of the particles beyond the vortex centre in the\nradial direction.\n\n%FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\hsize]{f2a.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\hsize]{f2b.pdf}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:g1n_shift_ts}Time evolution of the particles shift\n  angle (left panel) and Stokes number (right panel) in model\n  g5n.

This\nis illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:g1n_shift_ts}, which displays the\ntime evolution of the particles shift angle (left panel) and Stokes\nnumber (right panel). We see that the Stokes numbers all decrease by\nabout 45\\% between 200 and 500 orbits, which is due to the increase in\nthe gas surface density during vortex migration (the vortex migrates\nfrom $r \\approx 0.72$ to $r \\approx 0.55$ between 200 and 500 orbits).\nVariations in the particles shift angle are not as straightforward to\nexplain. We observe that shift angles tend to decrease with time for\nparticles with St $\\lesssim1$, and to increase with time for St\n$\\gtrsim 2$. At the end of the simulation, St $\\sim 2$ particles reach\na shift angle $\\gtrsim 25$ degrees, which is the largest offset that\nwe have obtained over the duration of our simulations without\nself-gravity. Tests of convergence with varying grid resolution are\nprovided in Section~\\ref{sec:conv} of the Appendix.\n\nAs a brief summary of our results without self-gravity, we confirm the\nqualitative trend found by \\cite{MC15} that dust grains with Stokes\nnumber near unity are shifted azimuthally ahead of the horseshoe\ncentre. The particles' shift is therefore not specific to their model,\nwhere gas horseshoe streamlines result from a manually imposed\ncircular motion of the star about the system barycentre, and can be\nobtained self-consistently in hydrodynamical simulations of discs\nunstable against the RWI.\n\n\n% --------------------------\n\\subsection{Models with gas self-gravity}\n% --------------------------\n\\label{sec:w}\nFor models with self-gravity, the RWI takes longer to form a fully\ndeveloped vortex than in models without self-gravity. The amplitude of\nthe $m=1$ mode in the Fourier analysis of the gas surface density\npeaks at about 40, 60 and 50 orbits for models g2, g5 and g10,\nrespectively (it is about twice as long as in the models without\nself-gravity). Its stationary value is about twice as small with\nself-gravity than without, illustrating that gas self-gravity hinders\nthe RWI \\citep{GN88}.\n\nFor some of the models with self-gravity, the dust concentration is\nsensitive to the initial distribution of the particles, in particular\nwhether dust is introduced before or after the vortex forms\n(specifically, the ring-like structures formed by the dust grains in\nmodel g5, which will be shown in Section~\\ref{sec:g5}, tend to be\ndisrupted when particles are introduced before the vortex forms - they\nrather take the form of arc rings). However, when dust particles are\nintroduced after the vortex reaches a quasi-steady state, their\nconcentration shows overall marginal dependence on the initial\ndistribution. For comparison purposes, all simulations with\nself-gravity have been restarted at 250 orbits (long after the vortex\nforms) by introducing the particles between $r=1.2$ and 1.4 with a\nuniform distribution.\n\n\n%FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\hsize]{f4a.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\hsize]{f4b.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\hsize]{f4c.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\hsize]{f4d.pdf}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:ph}Results of simulations with large (typically\n  metre-sized) particles with model g2 (three leftmost panels) and\n  model g2n (right panel).

Results are shown with\npolar coordinates $\\{r,\\varphi\\}$ and the maximum in the gas surface\ndensity is set at $\\varphi=0$. For comparison, the results of model\ng2n (without self-gravity) are shown at the same time in the middle\npanel of Figure~\\ref{fig:g13_rf2}, using the same colour scale for the\ndensity contours (recall that, without self-gravity, particle\nconcentration is found to be independent of the initial particle\ndistribution).  We first see that vortex inward migration is much less\nrapid with self-gravity, and consequently the gas surface density in\nthe vortex is smaller with self-gravity at the same time.  Actually,\nthe vortex's shape and strength at 500 orbits in model g2 are,\noverall, very similar to those of model g2n at $\\sim$$130$ orbits (not\nshown here). A qualitative comparison of the two models at these times\nindicates that the density contrast in the vortex's spiral waves is\nsmaller with self-gravity, which is consistent with inward migration\nbeing slower in that case. A detailed interpretation for why gas\nself-gravity slows down the vortex's inward migration is beyond the\nscope of this paper. Part of it could be due to self-gravity\ninhibiting the RWI and thus weakening the vortex when the disc's\nsurface density near the vortex's location is large enough\n\\citep[][see also Paper I]{GN88}. It is also possible that gas\nself-gravity shifts the location of the vortex's Lindblad resonances\n(where the flow becomes supersonic relative to the vortex). By analogy\nwith the analytic study of \\cite{PH05} for planet-disc interactions,\ngas self-gravity would shift Lindblad resonances outward compared to\nthe situation where the vortex would migrate in a non self-gravitating\ndisc.  This would weaken the vortex's outer wave, strengthen the inner\nwave, and explain the slowing down of the migration (with some\nanalogy, again, with planet-disc interactions, see \\citealp{BM08b}).\n\nThe location of dust particles of various sizes is marked by filled\ncircles in the left and middle panels of Figure~\\ref{fig:g13_rf2}, and\ntheir instantaneous Stokes number is shown in the panels. For model g2\nagain, dust grains quickly converge to specific locations in the disc\nwhere a force balance is reached. However, particle concentration\noperates differently with gas self-gravity: the particles shift angle\nrelative to the vortex centre increases monotonically with Stokes\nnumber, ranging from $\\approx 0$ degrees for St $\\sim 0.02$ to\n$\\approx$ 90 degrees for St $\\sim 16$. As shown again in the middle\npanel of Figure~\\ref{fig:g13_rf2} for model g2n, shift angles without\nself-gravity increase with St up to St $\\sim 1$, and decrease to zero\nbeyond.  The comparison between models g2 and g2n is further\nhighlighted in the right panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:g13_rf2}, which\ndisplays the shift angle and Stokes number at 500 orbits with and\nwithout self-gravity.  We stress the rapid increase of the shift angle\nwith self-gravity when St $\\gtrsim 1$. This transition occurs for\nparticles of a few centimetres in size when using the set of physical\nunits given as example in Section~\\ref{sec:codeunits}. The location\nwhere particles concentrate in model g2 is found to be independent of\ntheir initial distribution (e.g., inside or outside the vortex's\nradial location), at least for the particle sizes shown in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:g13_rf2}. Larger particles than those shown in the\nfigure can display a different behaviour, which we describe below.\n\nTo get more insight into the behaviour of the largest particles with\ngas self-gravity, we show the evolution of particles 4 times larger\nthan the largest particles displayed in Figure~\\ref{fig:g13_rf2}.\nTheir physical radius is 2 metres using the set of physical units\ngiven in Section~\\ref{sec:codeunits}, and their initial distribution\nis again uniform between $r=1.2$ and 1.4. The time evolution of their\nlocation relative to the vortex is illustrated in the three leftmost\npanels in Figure~\\ref{fig:ph}. As particles drift in toward the\nvortex, they make a horseshoe U-turn ahead of the vortex centre\n(leftmost panel).  Later, particles go on to a second U-turn (outward\nthis time, second panel on the left). Because of gas drag, the second\nU-turn is closer to the vortex's radial location, but further away in\nthe azimuthal direction. Particles eventually drift toward their\nequilibrium location about 90-100 degrees ahead of the vortex (third\npanel). Gas streamlines, which are overplotted by white curves in the\npanels, recall that gas does not make horseshoe U-turns relative to\nthe vortex. So do not the smallest particles, which concentrate\ntowards the vortex centre. Gas streamlines also indicate that the\nequilibrium location of the largest particles is very close to the tip\nof the elliptical streamline that lies furthest from the vortex. The\nrightmost panel in Figure~\\ref{fig:ph} shows the result of the same\nsimulation without self-gravity, and it is clear that the large\nparticles drift toward the vortex centre upon adopting elliptical\ntrajectories relative to the vortex.\n\nThe horseshoe U-turns performed by large particles is most likely the\nconsequence of the particles feeling the self-gravitating acceleration\nof the gas and interacting with the vortex partly as if it was a\nmassive body. Like if it was a planet. Using the analogy with\ndisc-planet interactions, we interpret our results based on the\ncomparison between three timescales: (i) the timescale for dust\nparticles to drift across the half-width of the vortex's horseshoe\nregion ($\\tau_{\\rm drift}$), (ii) the timescale for particles to make\na U-turn relative to the vortex ($\\tau_{\\rm U-turn}$), and (iii) the\ntimescale for particles to complete a full horseshoe orbit relative to\nthe vortex (libration timescale, $\\tau_{\\rm lib} >\n  \\tau_{\\rm U-turn}$). When $\\tau_{\\rm drift} \\leq \\tau_{\\rm\n  U-turn}$, gas drag prevents dust particles from making horseshoe\nU-turns, and dust drifts towards the vortex's centre much like when\nself-gravity is discarded. When $\\tau_{\\rm lib} > \\tau_{\\rm drift} \n\\gtrsim \\tau_{\\rm U-turn}$, dust particles can\nembark on, but not complete, horseshoe\ntrajectories. Gas drag still acts to damp the relative velocity\nbetween dust and gas, and particles thus progressively concentrate at\nor near the vortex's radial location (as can be seen in the two middle\npanels in Figure~\\ref{fig:ph}). When $\\tau_{\\rm drift} \\gg \\tau_{\\rm\n  lib}$, that is when the drag force is much smaller than the\neffective gravitational force from the vortex, particles should\nundergo horseshoe orbits very similar to those a nearly inviscid gas\nwould adopt in the presence of a planet. This is shown in the limit of\nfully decoupled particles ($\\tau_{\\rm drift} \\rightarrow \\infty$) in\nSection~\\ref{sec:pinf} of the Appendix.\n\nThe particle Stokes number for which $\\tau_{\\rm drift} \\gtrsim\n\\tau_{\\rm U-turn}$, and for which dust can embark on horseshoe U-turns\nrelative to the vortex, can be estimated as follows.  We have\n$\\tau_{\\rm drift} = x_{\\rm s} / |v_{\\rm r,dust}|$ with $x_{\\rm s}$ the\nhalf-width of the vortex's horseshoe region and $v_{\\rm r,dust}$ the\nparticle radial velocity. In a 1D isothermal gas disc, and neglecting\nthe contribution of gas self-gravity to the azimuthal velocities of\nthe gas and dust, $v_{\\rm r,dust}$ is given by\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{TakeuchiLin02}\n\\begin{equation}\nv_{\\rm r,dust} = \\frac{1}{1+{\\rm St}^2} \\left( \nv_{\\rm r,gas} + h^2 v_{\\rm K} {\\rm St} \\frac{\\partial\\log\\Sigma}{\\partial\\log r}\n\\right),\n\\label{eq:vrdust}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $v_{\\rm r,gas}$ is the radial velocity of the gas and $v_{\\rm\n  K}$ is the Keplerian velocity. All quantities in\nEq.~(\\ref{eq:vrdust}) should be evaluated at the separatrices of the\nvortex's horseshoe region (that is, at $r = r_{\\rm v} \\pm x_{\\rm s}$,\nwith $r_{\\rm v}$ the vortex's radial location). Progress can be made\nby considering the 2D structure of the vortex. For model g2, our\nnumerical simulations show that $v_{\\rm r,gas}$ is fairly well\napproximated by\n\\begin{equation}\nv_{\\rm r,gas} = -\\frac{5h^2}{2} v_{\\rm K} \\frac{\\partial\\log\\Sigma}{\\partial\\varphi}, \n\\end{equation}\nwhich is actually 5 times the first-order correction for the gas\nradial velocity to maintain a geostrophic flow about the vortex\n(balance between Coriolis and pressure forces; see, e.g., equation 16\nin \\citealp{MC15}). The difference accounts for the zero-order radial\nvelocity of the gas. We then find that $v_{\\rm r,gas}(r = r_{\\rm v}\n\\pm x_{\\rm s}) \\approx \\pm h^2 v_{\\rm K}$, with $v_{\\rm r,gas}(r =\nr_{\\rm v} - x_{\\rm s})$ evaluated behind the vortex in the azimuthal\ndirection (where outward U-turns occur), and similarly $v_{\\rm\n  r,gas}(r = r_{\\rm v} + x_{\\rm s})$ is evaluated ahead of the vortex\nin the azimuthal direction (where inward U-turns occur). The radial\ndensity profile of the gas being weakly altered by the vortex's\nformation, the last term in the bracket in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:vrdust}) can\nbe calculated with the initial surface density profile, which gives\n$\\partial\\log\\Sigma / \\partial\\log r (r = r_{\\rm v} \\pm x_{\\rm s}) =\n\\mp r_{\\rm v} x_{\\rm s} / 4H^2$. Eq.~(\\ref{eq:vrdust}) can finally be\nrecast as\n\\begin{equation}\nv_{\\rm r,dust}(r = r_{\\rm v} \\pm x_{\\rm s}) = \\frac{v_{\\rm K}}{1+{\\rm St}^2} \\left( \n\\pm h^2\n\\mp \\frac{{\\rm St}}{4} \\frac{x_{\\rm s}}{r_{\\rm v}} \n\\right).\n\\label{eq:vrdust2}\n\\end{equation}\nWe first note that, for dust horseshoe U-turns to be possible, we need\n$v_{\\rm r,dust}(r = r_{\\rm v} - x_{\\rm s}) > 0$ (outward U-turn) and\n$v_{\\rm r,dust}(r = r_{\\rm v} + x_{\\rm s}) < 0$ (inward U-turn), which\nimplies ${\\rm St} > 4h^2 r_{\\rm v}/x_{\\rm s}$.  For the vortex in\nmodel g2, $x_{\\rm s} / r_{\\rm v} \\approx 0.04$ and above inequality\nbecomes St $\\gtrsim 1$. From our numerical simulations, we find\n$\\tau_{\\rm U-turn} \\sim (2-3)\\times T_{\\rm orb}$\nwhich, as expected, is a small fraction of $\\tau_{\\rm lib}$\n($\\tau_{\\rm lib} = 8\\pi r_{\\rm v} / 3\\Omega x_{\\rm s} \\approx 35\nT_{\\rm orb}$). Using Eq.~(\\ref{eq:vrdust2}), we finally find that\n$\\tau_{\\rm drift} \\gtrsim \\tau_{\\rm U-turn}$ for St $\\gtrsim 2-4$. It\nis in good agreement with the range of Stokes numbers from which gas\nself-gravity considerably increases the particle shift angle in model\ng2 (see right panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:g13_rf2}).\n\nFor completeness, we mention that the same self-gravitating simulation\nas shown in the three leftmost panels in Figure~\\ref{fig:ph}, but\nwhere particles are placed initially between $r=0.5$ and 0.7, result\nin the particles concentrating both ahead (at $\\sim$$100$ degrees) and\nbehind (at $\\sim$$-100$ degrees) the vortex centre. This shows that\nthe concentration of the largest particles, either far ahead of far\nbehind the vortex, depends on the relative flow between the dust and\nthe vortex, that is on the initial location of the particles (inside\nor outside the vortex's radial location), as well as the direction of\nvortex migration (not shown here). We point out again the analogy with\ndisc-planet interactions, where gas drifting relative to a low-mass\nplanet -- because the planet migrates and/or the gas drifts viscously\n-- can be trapped ahead or behind the planet \\citep{masset02, SJP14,\n  Pierens15}. We also stress the analogy with the\n  trapping of solid particles on tadpole orbits around a planet in the\n  presence of gas drag \\citep[e.g.,][]{Peale93, Lyra09}. The\n  equilibrium location of solid particles ahead or behind the planet\n  depends on the planet's mass and on the particle size, and,\n  interestingly, the maximum shift angle of solid particles ahead of a\n  planet is 108 degrees \\citep{Peale93}, which is very close to the\n  maximum shift angle that we find for a self-gravitating vortex.\n  \nAs a brief summary of our results for model g2, we find that gas\nself-gravity controls the dynamics of large particles, whereas gas\ndrag determines the dynamics of small particles.  Self-gravity allows\nthe largest particles to concentrate far ahead of the vortex (or far\nbehind it) upon adopting horseshoe U-turns. Gas drag prevents small\nparticles from taking the U-turns. The transition between what could\nbe called a gas drag-dominated regime and a self-gravity-dominated\nregime occurs quite neatly around St $\\approx 1$ for model\ng2. However, the Stokes number at this transition likely depends on\nthe disc mass. For example, in a disc with lower gas surface density\nnear the vortex's radial location, the magnitude of the drag force\nwill be approximately the same for a given Stokes number\n(approximately since the vortex's shape and strength may vary with the\ndisc's surface density), but the gravitational force from the vortex\nwill be smaller since the vortex is less massive. Results of\nsimulations at lower gas surface densities will be presented at the\nbeginning of Section~\\ref{sec:synthetic}, which indicate that the\ntransition between the gas drag and self-gravity dominated regimes\noccurs around a critical particle size.\n\n% -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - \n\\subsubsection{Results of model g5}\n% -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - \n\\label{sec:g5}\n%FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=0.47\\hsize]{f5a.pdf}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.47\\hsize]{f5b.pdf}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:g1_rf2}Results of model g5 at 500 orbits.

We see that both the gas structure and the dust\ndistribution are markedly different from those of model g2, while the\ninitial gas densities differ by only a factor of 2.5 between both\nmodels (compare with the left panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:g13_rf2}). In\nmodel g5, the vortex is more elongated along the azimuthal direction\nand the density contrast is about 20\\%. For comparison, in model g2\nthe density contrast along the vortex is by a factor of\n$\\sim$$2$. Furthermore, in model g5 the gas density maximum in the\nvortex is still very close to $r = 1$, indicating that the vortex has\nnot migrated over the duration of the simulation. This is supported by\na detailed inspection at the gas density which shows marginal\nexcitation of density waves by the vortex compared to model g2. Also,\nwe notice that the radial location where elliptical streamlines are\ncentred in the frame rotating at the vortex's pattern frequency, which\ndefines the vortex's corotation radius, is shifted outward from the\nvortex's radial location (defined as the radial location where the gas\nsurface density peaks).  This shows that the vortex's pattern\nfrequency is slower than the Keplerian frequency (Paper I). This slow\npattern frequency is probably the reason why the vortex emits no or\nvery little spiral density waves in the disc. The slow pattern\nfrequency also directly impacts the particles distribution. Most of\nthe small particles get trapped onto the elliptical streamlines in the\nrotating frame and progressively drift toward the centre of the set of\nelliptical streamlines (which actually corresponds to a minimum in the\ngas potential vorticity or vortensity). This is what we obtain for the\nSt $\\sim$ 0.01 particles (see the single blue dot at $r \\approx$ 1.12\nin the left panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:g1_rf2}).  Note, however, that\nsome of the St $\\sim$ 0.01 particles form a ring-like structure around\nthe vortex's radial location at $r \\approx$ 1.\n\nLarger particles decouple from the gas and are not tied to the\nelliptical streamlines: they converge toward the pressure maximum\nlocated at $r \\approx$ 1. They also form ring-like structures, though\nthe left panel in Figure~\\ref{fig:g1_rf2} does not hint at the\nparticles azimuthal distribution. The latter is shown as an histogram\nin the right panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:g1_rf2}, with large bins used to\nsmooth high spatial frequency fluctuations (the y-values in the\nhistogram are simply the fraction of the total number of particles in\neach bin). Azimuths are relative to the vortex centre.  More than half\nof the smallest (St $\\sim$ 0.01) particles are at $\\varphi \\sim$ 0,\nwith the vast majority of them at the centre of the elliptical\nstreamlines. Larger particles show quite distinct azimuthal\ndistributions.  St $\\sim$ 0.1 particles have a lopsided distribution\nthat peaks slightly ahead of the vortex. The fact it peaks ahead of\nthe vortex is just a coincidence: since St $\\sim$ 0.1 particles and\nthe vortex move at different speeds, the azimuth at which the\nparticles' azimuthal distribution peaks varies with time. Finally,\nwhile St $\\sim$ 1 particles have a nearly flat azimuthal distribution,\nSt $\\sim$ 10 particles feature a periodic pattern of azimuthal\nwavenumber $m=6$. The reason for this particular pattern is unknown,\nbut resembles that of the St $\\sim$ 0.01 particles located around the\nvortex's radial location.  We find the same pattern when adopting a\nslightly different initial distribution (uniform in $r \\in\n[0.8-1.2]$). We also comment that the vortex's corotation radius\nbecomes less shifted as grid resolution is increased. It is located at\n$r \\approx 1.05$ for a grid resolution increased to $600\\times 1000$,\ncompared to $r \\approx 1.12$ for our nominal resolution of $300\\times\n600$.

By doing this we expect to see a smooth\ntransition in the concentration of the large dust grains from\nring-like structures (as in model g5) to point-like structures (as in\nmodel g2). Specifically, as in \\cite{BP13} we adopt a simple\nexponential decay of the density profile by solving $\\partial_t \\Sigma\n= -(\\overline{\\Sigma} - \\Sigma_{\\rm target})/\\tau$ alongside the\nhydrodynamical equations, with $\\overline{\\Sigma}$ the\nazimuthally-averaged density profile at restart time, $\\Sigma_{\\rm\n  target} = 10^{-3}\\overline{\\Sigma}$ an arbitrarily small density\nprofile that we take to be not zero for numerical convenience, and\n$\\tau$ is chosen to be 300 orbits. In practice, the axisymmetric\nprofile of gas density is decreased by a factor $\\sim$10 in about 700\norbits after the restart. The results of this simulation are displayed\nat four different times in Figure~\\ref{fig:g1r}, where the Stokes\nnumbers shown in the panel are averaged in space (they increase with\ntime as the gas surface density decreases). The first panel from the\nleft is at 700 orbits (350 orbits after the restart).  Interestingly,\nthe gas density profile now takes smaller values than in model g2, yet\nboth the gas and the dust distributions are very similar to those of\nmodel g5 prior to the restart. We note a few differences, though.\nFirst, the centre of the gas elliptical streamlines in the rotating\nframe is slightly closer to the vortex's centre (its radial location\nhas decreased from $r \\approx 1.12$ to $r \\approx 1.08$). Second and\nprobably related point, the smallest particles that are located around\nthe vortex's radial location now form a disrupted ring (see the\ndark-blue dots in the panel). In the second panel (at 860 orbits), the\ncentre of the elliptical streamlines has become close enough to the\nvortex centre to significantly perturb the smallest particles, which\nbecome trapped onto elliptical streamlines. In the third panel (1040\norbits), the centre of the elliptical streamlines now coincides with\nthe vortex centre, which indicates that the vortex's pattern frequency\nis now very close to the Keplerian frequency.  In addition, the vortex\nis now less elongated along the azimuthal direction (the density\ncontrast along the vortex increases) and it has started to migrate\ninward (the vortex's radial location has decreased from $r \\approx 1$\nto $\\approx 0.92$ from 860 to 1040 orbits). Particles with the two\nsmallest sizes now have point-like distributions (dark-blue and cyan\ndots in the panel), while the largest particles are getting trapped\nmuch ahead of the vortex. In the fourth panel (1270 orbits) particles\nhave point-like distributions which are very close to those shown in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:g13_rf2} for model g2.\n\nBefore closing this subsection, we come back to the evolution of the\nvortex's pattern frequency with gas self-gravity. We have seen that,\nwith increasing strength of self-gravity, the radial location where\nthe gas potential vorticity is minimum (the vortex's corotation\nradius) shifts outward from the radial location where the gas density\npeaks (which we have defined throughout this study as the vortex's\nradial location). This is further illustrated and quantified in the\nleft panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:vps} for the restart simulation with\nmodel g5 where the gas density decreases over time. We have calculated\nthe vortex's pattern frequency by measuring the angle through which\nthe density maximum rotates over time (it is the same angle as that\nthrough which the minimum potential vorticity rotates over time). The\ntime evolution of the vortex's pattern frequency is displayed in the\nright panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:vps}. Dashed curves show the Keplerian\nfrequency at the radial location where the gas density is maximum (in\nblack) and where the potential vorticity (vortensity) is maximum (in\nred). The vortex's pattern frequency nearly equals the Keplerian\nfrequency at the radial location of the vortensity minimum, as\nexpected, and catches up with the Keplerian frequency at the density\nmaximum as the strength of self-gravity decreases.\n\n\n\n% -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - \n\\subsubsection{Results of model g10}\n% -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - \n\\label{sec:g10}\nThe results of model g10 are displayed in Figure~\\ref{fig:g10_rf2} at\n500 orbits. Overall, the gas and dust distributions are similar to\nthose of model g5 at the same time (compare with\nFigure~\\ref{fig:g1_rf2}). The smallest particles also tend to\nconcentrate at the centre of the elliptical streamlines located at the\nvortex's corotation radius. The latter is shifted further outside the\nvortex's radial location compared to model g5 (the vortex's corotation\nradius is at $r \\approx 1.2$ for model g10 and at $r \\approx 1.12$ for\nmodel g5). This goes along the trend illustrated at the end of the\nprevious subsection that the larger the disc mass (that is, the\nstronger self-gravity), the slower is the vortex's pattern frequency\ncompared to the Keplerian frequency. Larger particles concentrate\nalong rings with different azimuthal structures depending on the\nparticle size (and thus Stokes number). Figure~\\ref{fig:g10_rf2} also\ndisplays the results of model g10 with a grid resolution increased\nfrom $300\\times600$ to $600\\times1000$ (middle panel, filled circles\nin the right panel). Results at both resolutions are in fairly good\nagreement.  The vortex's corotation radius decreases from $r \\approx\n1.2$ at a resolution of $300\\times600$ to $r \\approx 1.18$ at a\nresolution of $600\\times1000$. Convergence in resolution is much\nbetter than for model g5, which suggests that the transition to the\nregime where self-gravity renders the vortex's pattern frequency\nsub-Keplerian is very sensitive to grid resolution.\n%FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.83\\hsize]{f9.pdf}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:depth} Shift angle relative to the vortex centre\n  for various particle sizes in models g2, g0p5 and g0p2.

We have shown this behaviour to\nbe related to horseshoe U-turns performed by the large particles\nrelative to the vortex before they drift to their equilibrium location\nthrough gas drag.  In this section, we report the results of a\nsimulation with model g2 and fully decoupled dust particles. At 250\norbits, we restarted the simulation by introducing 100 000 particles\nwith a sharply decreasing radial distribution in\n$r\\in[0.9-1]$. Results are displayed in Figure~\\ref{fig:pinf} at 21\norbits after the restart (upper panels) and 527 orbits after (lower\npanels). While the left panels help locate the particles relative to\nthe vortex, the right panels display the dust's density distribution,\nwhich we simply calculate as the number of particles per grid\ncell. The upper-right panel is strongly suggestive that the particles\nnumber density is advected inside what already appears as the vortex's\nhorseshoe region. In comparison, in the lower panels the vortex has\nslightly migrated inward, with two notable consequences: (i) the dust\ndensity is nearly uniform in the distinct horseshoe region of the\nvortex, and (ii) the region of highest dust density, which is\ninitially inside the vortex's orbit, ends up circulating relative to\nthe vortex beyond its horseshoe region. These results are analogous to\nthe advection of gas potential vorticity and/or entropy in the\npresence of a low-mass planet \\citep[e.g.,][]{BaruteauPP6}.\n\nIn the lower panels of Figure~\\ref{fig:pinf}, the full width of the\nvortex's horseshoe region is $\\approx 0.07$. Although the vortex is\nnot a point mass, it is instructive to compare its horseshoe width to\nthat expected for a planet with the same mass. We\n  estimate the mass of the vortex ($m_{\\rm v}$) as the mass between $r\n  = 0.84$ and $r=0.95$, $\\varphi = \\pm \\pi/4$, and having uniform\n  surface density $\\approx 3\\times 10^{-3}$ in code units (see\n  lower-left panel in Figure~\\ref{fig:pinf}).  We obtain $m_{\\rm v}\n  \\approx 4.6\\times10^{-4}M_{\\star}$. In the circular restricted\n  three-body problem, the maximum full width of the horseshoe region\n  of a planet with mass $m_{\\rm v}$ and orbital distance $r_{\\rm v}$\n  is $2\\sqrt{12}\\times r_{\\rm v}(m_{\\rm v}/3M_{\\star})^{1/3}$\n  \\citep{MurrayDermottBook}, which amounts here to $\\approx 0.33$.\n  Using three-body integrations, we find that the maximum full width\n  for test particles to undergo periodic horseshoe trajectories with a\n  small epicyclic motion is $\\approx 0.10$, which is about twice the\n  planet's Hill radius ($2r_{\\rm v} ( m_{\\rm v}/\n  3M_{\\star})^{1/3}$). Finally, the maximum full width of the planet's\n  horseshoe region in the gas with same aspect ratio ($h = 0.1$) and\n  same viscosity as in the simulations presented throughout this study\n  is $\\approx 0.14$. Not surprisingly, the width of the vortex's\n  horseshoe region is smaller than all above estimates for a planet\n  with the same mass as the vortex's. We note that, since $m_{\\rm v} /\n  M_{\\star} \\lesssim h^3$, the planet's horseshoe width in the gas\n  scales as $\\sqrt{m_{\\rm v}}$ \\citep[e.g.,][]{mak2006}, which\n  indicates that the vortex's horseshoe width in the simulation shown\n  in Figure~\\ref{fig:pinf} is very similar to that of the gas around a\n  planet of mass $m_{\\rm v}/4 \\approx 10^{-4}M_{\\star}$.\n\n% AAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\"), citations -> List{List{String(\"BaruteauPP6\")}, List{String(\"MurrayDermottBook\")}, List{String(\"mak2006\")}, List{}, List{}}}, introduction -> Map{text -> String(\"\n% ===============\n\\label{sec:intro}\nTransition discs are protoplanetary discs around young (1-10 Myr)\nstars with little or no emission in the near- and mid-IR but strong\nemission at longer wavelengths \\citep[see the review\nby][]{Espaillat14}. Modeling of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)\nof transition discs implies that their inner parts form dust cavities\nlargely devoid of small dust grains, followed by cold dust populating\nan outer disc. Interferometric imaging shows that the cavities also\nhave a deficit in (sub-)mm continuum emission and are mostly devoid of\nlarge dust grains. Cavities typically span a few tens of Astronomical\nUnits (AU) like in LkCa 15 \\citep[$\\sim$50 AU;][]{Andrews11} and AB\nAur \\citep[$\\gtrsim$70 AU;][]{Pietu05}, with minimum and maximum sizes\nso far in TW Hya \\citep[$\\sim$4 AU;][]{Hughes07} and HD 142527\n\\citep[$\\sim$140 AU;][]{Casassus13,Avenhaus14}. A subset of transition\ndiscs shows significant near-IR excesses. These so-called\npre-transition discs feature an optically thick inner disc of\ntypically $\\sim$1 AU between the star and the cavity, and some of them\nhave accretion rates exceeding a few $\\times 10^{-8} M_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm\n  yr}^{-1}$ \\citep[][and references therein]{Espaillat14}. There is\ngrowing observational evidence that gas is present in the dust\ncavities of (pre-)transition discs, though at a reduced level compared\nto the outer disc \\citep{Carmona14,Bruderer14}.  The decrease in gas\nsurface density inside the cavity varies from 1 to 4 orders of\nmagnitude \\citep{vanderMarel2015}.\n\nSeveral origins for the diversity of cavity sizes and accretion rates\nhave been explored. One is grain growth and the consequent decrease in\nthe dust emissivity: cavities would be only apparent. In the inner\ndisc, however, grain growth is shown to be limited by destructive\ncollisions to mm/cm particles, which should be detected in the\nsub-mm. It therefore appears difficult for fragmentation-limited grain\ngrowth to simultaneously account for the near-IR dip in the SED of\ntransition discs and their deficit in sub-mm continuum emission\n\\citep{Birnstiel2012}. Alternatively, large dust and gas cavities\ncould be cleared via photoevaporative winds. A broad range of\naccretion rates is expected depending on the level of high-energy\nstellar radiation (extreme UV and X-Ray), consistent with the\ndiversity of accretion rates observed in transition discs \\citep[see\nthe review by][]{AlexanderPP6}. However, current models of\nphoto-evaporation cannot account for discs with both large cavities\n($\\gtrsim 10$ AU) and substantial accretion rates \\citep[$\\gtrsim\n10^{-9} M_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$;][]{Owen11}, nor discs with moderate\ndrops in the gas surface density within the cavity.\n\nA third mechanism for sculpting the cavities of transition discs is\ndynamical clearing by one or several companions.  These can be stellar\ncompanions. For example, \\cite{Casassus15b} describe how a highly\nmutually inclined stellar companion to HD 142527 can generate the fast\nradial flows inside the cavity of its transition disc\n\\citep{Rosenfeld14}. These fast radial flows could explain how disc\nholes could be simultaneously transparent and still contain material\nthat accretes at rates $\\gtrsim 10^{-9} M_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$\n\\citep{Rosenfeld14}. Companions can also be planets. The salient point\nis that the size of the gap opened by a massive planet differs in the\ngas and in the dust. Gaps in the gas are narrow. For example, for a\nJupiter-mass planet orbiting a Solar-mass star, the half-width of the\ngap does not exceed $\\sim$40$\\%$ of the star-planet separation, even\nin discs with very low turbulent activity \\citep{crida06}. Gaps in the\ndust depend on the size of the dust particles or, more generally, on\nthe coupling between dust and gas (quantified by the Stokes number,\nsee Section~\\ref{sec:model_pc}).  Dust grains up to few tens of\nmicrons are tied to the gas, so the width of their gap is basically\nthe same as the gas \\citep{pm04,Fouchet07,Zhu12}.  Dust in the mm/cm\nrange, however, is not tied to the gas and drifts generally inward as\na result of gas friction. Radial drift can, however, stall at\nlocations known as dust traps where the gas pressure is maximum\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{Pinilla12,JohansenPP6}. Simulations of disc-planet\ninteractions show that the outer edge of a planet gap is generally a\nrobust pressure maximum while the inner edge is not: large dust grains\ninitially beyond the planet's orbit can be trapped efficiently at the\ngap's outer edge while the large dust grains initially inside the\nplanet's orbit migrate inward \\citep[e.g.,][]{Zhu12,Zhu14}. This\nimplies that a single massive planet could simultaneously carve a\nlarge cavity in mm-grains and a narrow gap in $\\mu$m-grains, with\ntherefore no or limited impact on the accretion rate. Large cavities\nin $\\mu$m-grains and strong reductions in the accretion rate are not\nnatural outcomes of disc-planet interactions, though they can be\nobtained by invoking several massive planets in the disc\n\\citep{Zhu11}.\n\nRecent high-resolution interferometric imaging (especially with ALMA)\nhas highlighted that the mm emission rings of transition discs are\noften non-axisymmetric. Several of them feature large-scale lopsided\nstructures with distinct crescent or horseshoe shapes. These include\nHD 142527 \\citep{Casassus13,Fukagawa14}, Oph IRS 48\n\\citep{vanderMarel13}, AB Aur \\citep{Tang12}, SR21\n\\citep{Andrews11all,Perez14}, LkH$\\alpha$ 330 \\citep{Isella13} and HD\n135344B \\citep{Brown09,Perez14}.  Intensity variations along the\nlopsided rings are by factors of $\\sim$2-3 for SR21, LkH$\\alpha$, AB\nAur and HD 135344B, $\\sim$30 for HD 142527 and $>$100 for Oph IRS\n48. In contrast, the gas emission is generally more symmetric along\nthe lopsided rings \\citep{vanDishoeck2015}. These findings are so far\nbest explained by the presence of a long-lived vortex in the gas that\nwould efficiently trap mm-grains.\n\nProbably the most promising vortex-forming instability in the context\nof lopsided transition discs is the Rossby-Wave Instability\n\\citep[RWI,][]{lovelace99}. It is essentially the form of the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability in a differentially rotating disc, and a\nthin-disc version of the Papaloizou-Pringle instability\n\\citep{PP84}. It is a linear instability associated with a radial\nminimum in the gas potential vorticity which, in practice, can be\ntriggered where the pressure has a radial maximum. This may occur (i)\nnear the disc's centrifugal radius due to mass infall from the\nprotostellar cloud \\citep{Bae15}, (ii) at the outer edge of a\ngap-opening planet \\citep[e.g.,][]{Lyra09,LinMK12}, (iii) at the edges\nbetween magnetically active and inactive (dead) regions\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{VT06,Regaly12,Faure14,Lyra15,Flock15}, or (iv) at the\nedge of a disc undergoing photo-evaporation, though to our knowledge\nthis latter scenario has not been examined yet. The planet gap\nscenario has received the most attention, but detailed modeling is\nstill needed to reproduce observed distributions of gas and dust, like\nin the Oph IRS 48 disc \\citep{ZhuStone14}. The dead/active regions\nscenario needs more exploration, in particular to determine the\nefficiency of non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic effects at suppressing\nthe magneto-rotational instability in the outer regions of transition\ndiscs \\citep{Lesur14,Bai15,Gressel15}.\n\nAnother route to producing lopsided dust rings in transition discs has\nbeen recently examined by \\cite{MC15}. The authors proposed a model\nwhere a massive gas disc exhibits a mode with azimuthal wavenumber\n$m=1$ and pattern frequency comparable to the disc's Keplerian\nfrequency. Mutual gravitational interactions will cause the star and\ndisc to rotate about their centre-of-mass, which, if the disc is\nmassive enough, can sustain an $m=1$ perturbation where the gas\ndescribes horseshoe-shaped streamlines. Interestingly, \\cite{MC15}\nfound that dust grains with Stokes numbers around unity, that is with\naerodynamic stopping times around the orbital period, are not trapped\nat the horseshoe centre: they are shifted azimuthally by up to 45\ndegrees ahead of the horseshoe centre. These should be mm/cm-grains\ndepending on the gas surface density at the vortex's radial location,\nthus a significant shift of the grains location relative to the\nhorseshoe centre should be detectable via high-resolution\ninterferometry in the (sub-)mm.\n\nNonetheless, \\cite{MC15} left un-addressed several important issues.\nThey envisioned an $m=1$ mode based on the mutual interaction between\nthe lopsided disc and the star, but the trigger was not specified. We\npropose that it could be the RWI. Also, gas self-gravity was discarded\nalthough its acceleration can be as important as, if not larger than,\nthe indirect acceleration imparted by the star.  This we show in an\naccompanying paper (Zhu \\& Baruteau, submitted, hereafter Paper I),\nwhere we present results of hydrodynamic simulations with and without\ngas self-gravity, with lopsided gas distributions mediated by the\nRWI. While Paper I deals with gas only, the present paper presents\nresults of simulations with both gas and dust to investigate the\nconcentration of dust grains when varying the mass of the gas disc,\nwith a focus on large disc masses for which gas self-gravity should\nmatter most. The model set-up is described in\nSection~\\ref{sec:setup}. Results of simulations are presented in\nSection~\\ref{sec:results}, first without gas self-gravity in\nSection~\\ref{sec:wo}, then with self-gravity in\nSection~\\ref{sec:w}. These results are used to generate synthetic\nimages of dust continuum observations, which are presented in\nSection~\\ref{sec:synthetic}.

The lopsided distribution in the gas is obtained by\nadopting a ring-like gas density profile that becomes unstable against\nthe Rossby-wave instability.  The instability saturates into a\nlarge-scale vortex that efficiently traps the grains. This trapping\nmechanism is often invoked to interpret the crescent-shaped continuum\nemission imaged by sub-millimetre interferometers in some transition\ndiscs \\citep[e.g.,][]{Regaly12}.\n\nIn accompanying Paper I (Zhu \\& Baruteau, submitted) we explore the\nrole of gas self-gravity and of the disc mass in shaping the vortex\nstructure.  Their impact on the trapping of dust grains is the scope\nof the present paper. We first present results of models without gas\nself-gravity, for which we find that the indirect force resulting from\nthe displacement of the star by the vortex plays a prominent role in\nthe gas and dust dynamics, in agreement with \\cite{MC15}.  While\ngrains with Stokes number (stopping time to orbital time ratio, St)\nmuch smaller and much larger than unity are trapped near the vortex\ncentre, particles with St $\\sim 1$ are shifted ahead of the vortex in\nthe azimuthal direction. This is in good qualitative agreement with\nthe results of test particle integrations by \\cite{MC15}.  We find\nparticle shift angles relative to the vortex centre that go up to\n20-25 degrees for St $\\sim 2-4$ particles, depending on the disc mass,\nwhich strongly affects the shape and orbital evolution of the vortex.\nOur maximum shift angles are a factor $\\sim 2$ smaller than in\n\\cite{MC15}.\n\nWe then present results with gas self-gravity, and find that it\nlargely affects dust trapping in the vortex. At low to moderate gas\nsurface densities at the vortex's radial location (local Toomre\nparameter $\\gtrsim 10$), we find gas self-gravity to be most important\nfor large grains. Grains with St $\\lesssim 1$ (typically smaller than\n1 cm) have similar shift angles with and without self-gravity, as gas\ndrag plays a major role in determining the dynamics of small\nparticles.  The dynamics of larger particles (St $\\gtrsim 1$) becomes\nincreasingly dominated by gas self-gravity, and we find that shift\nangles increase very rapidly with increasing grain size\n(Figure~\\ref{fig:depth}). We find shift angles of about 50 degrees for\ngrains of 3-5 cm in size, and up to 90 degrees for $\\sim$ 10 cm\ngrains.  We show that these large shift angles result from the large\nparticles undergoing horseshoe U-turns relative to the vortex before\ndrifting to their equilibrium location via gas drag. The horseshoe\nU-turns arise because of the self-gravitating acceleration of the gas\nexerted on the particles, which therefore interact with the vortex as\nif it was a massive body. The limit case of fully decoupled particles\nactually shares a number of analogies with the evolution of inviscid\ngas near a low-mass planet. Synthetic images produced from our\nsimulations show that the size segregation caused by self-gravity\nbetween the smallest and largest grains at the vortex's radial\nlocation could cause a double peak in the dust's continuum emission,\ndepending on the dust's size distribution. The same size segregation,\nwhich does not mix the smallest and largest grains at the vortex\ncentre, could have interesting consequences on core growth inside the\nvortex, and on dust feedback onto the gas.\n\nAt large gas surface densities at the vortex's radial location (local\nToomre parameter $\\lesssim 10$), self-gravity renders the vortex's\npattern frequency slower than the Keplerian frequency.  This shifts\nthe vortex's corotation radius outside the radial location where the\nlopsided gas density distribution is maximum. Consequently, (most of)\nthe smallest particles concentrate in point-like distributions that\nare shifted slightly outside the gas density maximum. Conversely,\nlarger particles (St $\\gtrsim 0.1$) describe ring-like structures,\nsome of them lopsided, which are centred about the radial location\nwhere the gas density peaks (Figures~\\ref{fig:g1_rf2}\nand~\\ref{fig:g10_rf2}).\n\nOur study highlights that the concentration of large dust grains is\nsensitive to the shape of the vortex, which depends on the gas model.\nThe main result of Paper I is that self-gravity plays a prominent role\nin structuring the vortex in massive discs. The main result of the\npresent paper is that self-gravity plays a prominent role in setting\nparticle concentration within the vortex even at low disc masses.\n\nThere are several ways that the physical model used in this work can\nbe improved. Inclusion of an energy equation for the gas, of the\ndisc's vertical stratification (via 3D simulations), and of possibly\nimportant feedback effects of dust concentration onto the gas are some\nof them. Another outstanding question is that of the particles\nconcentration in a vortex formed at the outer edge of a gap-opening\nplanet, which could be significantly impacted by the planet wakes.\nMore generally, a pressing, yet unsolved issue is that of the\nexcitation and long-term maintenance of a large-scale vortex through\nthe RWI. In this work, we have assumed a narrow ring-like density\nprofile for the (nearly inviscid) gas plus an ad hoc $m=1$ seed\nperturbation; however, there is no robust way to generate\neither. Non-axisymmetric seed perturbations could be\ninduced by disc turbulence, embedded planet companions or nearby\nstars. Several mechanisms mentioned in the third-to-last paragraph in\nthe introduction could provide the necessary axisymmetric density\n(vortensity) extremum, like for instance an effective viscosity jump\nat the transition between magnetically active and inactive\nregions.

(In contrast, in\nmodels with larger gas densities like models g5 and g10, grains larger\nthan about 1 cm have non-axisymmetric ring-like distributions with\nnon-trivial dependence on grain size, and are non-stationary in a\nframe rotating at the vortex's frequency, which makes it more delicate\nto predict the corresponding dust continuum emission). Particle shift\nangles relative to the vortex centre are displayed in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:depth} for models g0p2, g0p5 and g2 at 500 orbits\nafter the beginning of the simulations (250 orbits after introduction\nof the particles). For each model, particles larger than the largest\nsize shown in the figure describe ring-like structures centred around\nthe vortex's radial location.\n\nTo translate the dust distribution in our simulations into dust\nsurface density, we assume that dust grains have a size distribution\n$n(s) \\propto s^{-p}$ from 30 $\\mu$m to 20 cm. The value of $p$ is\nvery uncertain, especially in the context of dust trapping in a\nvortex, and we allow it to vary from 3 to 2.5. We divide the above\nsize range into small size bins with a logarithmic spacing. We assume\nthat grains smaller than 0.5 mm follow the gas distribution, and that\nlarger grains have point-like distributions shifted ahead of the\nvortex. Particles are assigned shift angles ($\\delta\\varphi$) through\nfits of the results of simulations shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:depth}.\nFor model g2, we find good agreement with $\\delta\\varphi(s) =\n90^{\\circ} \\times 0.5 \\{1 + \\tanh(2.6 \\log_{10}(14s))\\}$ with $s$ in\nmetres (see the black dashed curve in Figure~\\ref{fig:depth}).  For\nmodel g0p5, we use $\\delta\\varphi(s) = 80^{\\circ}\\times 0.5 \\{1 +\n\\tanh(2.3 \\log_{10}(18s))\\}$ (blue dashed curve in the figure), and\nfor model g0p2, $\\delta\\varphi(s) = 70^{\\circ} \\times 0.5 \\{1 +\n\\tanh(2 \\log_{10}(33s))\\}$ (red dashed curve). The dust's surface\ndensity in each size bin is then derived assuming a total dust-to-gas\nmass ratio of 1\\%, and converting our results of simulations into\nphysical units using the set of units in Section~\\ref{sec:codeunits}.\n\nWe use Mie theory to determine the dust opacity in each size bin at a\nwavelength of 8 mm (37.5 GHz). See \\cite{ZhuStone14} for more details\n(their section 4.3). The dust opacities per unit dust mass at 8 mm are\n$1.2\\times10^{-3}$, $1.7\\times10^{-3}$, $1.4\\times10^{-2}$, 0.79,\n0.67, 0.15, $5.2\\times10^{-2}$ and $1.0\\times10^{-2}$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$\nfor grains of radius 30 $\\mu$m, 100 $\\mu$m, 300 $\\mu$m, 1 mm, 3 mm, 1\ncm, 3 cm and 20 cm. We finally multiply the dust's surface density in\neach size bin with the interpolated opacity and add these products\ntogether to get the disc's optical depth. Synthetic images are\nproduced by convolving the disc's optical depth with a Gaussian kernel\nof FWHM equal to 0.05\" or 0.2\". The disc is assumed to be located at\n140 parsecs and to be seen face-on.\n\nSynthetic images are displayed in Figure~\\ref{fig:synthetic} for\nmodels g0p2 (upper panels) and g2 (lower panels). Values of $p$ (minus\nthe power-law index of the dust size distribution), and of the FWHM of\nthe Gaussian kernel by which the total optical depth is convolved, are\nindicated in the top-left corner in the panels. These images show\nthat, for steep size distributions ($p \\geq 3$), the dust continuum\nemission at 8 mm displays a lopsided distribution with a peak emission\nat the vortex centre (where the gas surface density is maximum). For\nshallower size distributions ($p \\lesssim 2.5-3$), however, the dust\ncontinuum emission at 8 mm features a double-peaked distribution, with\none peak at the vortex centre, and a second peak shifted ahead of the\nvortex centre in the azimuthal direction, which corresponds to the\nemission of grains of a few centimetres in size.  The azimuthal shift\nof the second peak depends on the azimuthally-averaged surface density\nof the gas at the vortex's radial location, $\\langle\\Sigma_{\\rm\n  V}\\rangle$ (Figure~\\ref{fig:depth}). It is about 70 degrees in model\ng0p2, where $\\langle\\Sigma_{\\rm V}\\rangle \\approx 0.5$ g cm$^{-2}$ at\n$\\approx 50$ AU, and goes up to nearly 90 degrees in model g2, where\n$\\langle\\Sigma_{\\rm V}\\rangle \\approx 5$ g cm$^{-2}$ at $\\approx 60$\nAU.\n\nSuch double peak continuum emissions, if observed at mm/cm wavelengths\nlike with ALMA or the VLA, could reveal the size segregation due to\ngas self-gravity between small and large dust grains trapped in a\ncrescent-shaped vortex. There is so far no clear evidence for double\npeak emissions similar to what our dusty horseshoe model predicts. The\ndouble peak emission observed with ALMA in the HD 142527 disc is most\nprobably caused by shadows cast by the tilted inner disc over the\nlopsided outer disc \\citep{Casassus15,Marino15shadows}. VLA (0.9 cm)\nand ALMA Band 7 (0.8 mm) continuum emissions of the MWC 758 disc show\ntwo intensity peaks located to the north-west and to the south of the\nstar \\citep{Marino15MWC758}. These authors show that two dust-trapping\nvortices could account for the double peak continuum emissions, and\nthe fact the VLA emission is more compact than the ALMA emission. In\ntheir model, the vortex to the south would be slightly closer to the\nstar (at $\\sim 90$ AU) than the one to the north-west (at $\\sim 120$\nAU). It would be interesting to check whether our dusty horseshoe\nmodel, which comprises a single vortex, could also reproduce the\ndouble peak distribution in the MWC 758 disc. The large-scale spirals\nobserved in near-IR \\citep{Benisty15} could greatly complicate the\ndust concentration properties, whatever the number of dust-trapping\nvortices to reproduce the double peak continuum emission at mm/cm\nwavelengths. We also stress that in the synthetic sub-mm images of\n\\cite{Regaly12}, a single elongated vortex in the gas disc can produce\neither one or two peaks of emission due to beam dilution effects\n(especially when angular resolution is moderate and the beam is highly\nelongated; Zs.

The gas model is detailed in Paper I and briefly\nrecalled in Section~\\ref{sec:model_gas}. For this work, a particle\nintegrator has been implemented in FARGO-ADSG for the dust. The dust\nmodel is described in Section~\\ref{sec:model_pc}. Conversion of our\nresults of simulations from code units to physical units follows in\nSection~\\ref{sec:codeunits}.\n\n% --------------------------\n\\subsection{Gas}\n% --------------------------\n\\label{sec:model_gas}\nThe gas model and the initial conditions of the simulations are chosen\nto generate a long-lived elongated vortex through the\nRWI. Specifically, the initial surface density of the gas has a\n(modified) Gaussian radial profile of the form\n%\n\\begin{multline}\n  \\Sigma(r,\\varphi) = \\Sigma_0 \\left[10^{-2}\n    + \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{(r-r_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right\\}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\\n  \\times\\left[\n    1+10^{-3}\\times\\cos\\varphi\\times\\sin\\left(\\pi\\frac{r-r_{\\rm\n          in}}{r_{\\rm out}-r_{\\rm in}}\\right) \\right],\n          \\label{eq:Sigma0}\n\\end{multline}\n%\nwhere $\\Sigma_0$ is a free parameter that varies the disc mass, $r_0$\nis a reference radius that defines the code's unit of length, $\\sigma\n= 2H(r_0)$ with $H=c_{\\rm s} / \\Omega_{\\rm K}$ the disc's pressure\nscale height, $c_{\\rm s}$ the sound speed and $\\Omega_{\\rm K}$ the\nKeplerian angular frequency. We take $H$ equal to $0.1r$ and constant\nin time (the disc is assumed to be isothermal). The second bracket in\nthe above equation corresponds to a small perturbation of azimuthal\nwavenumber $m=1$ applied smoothly between the grid's inner edge\n($r_{\\rm in} = 0.2r_0$) and outer edge ($r_{\\rm out} = 2r_0$).\n\nThe gas disc that we simulate is therefore a narrow ring of gas rather\nthan an extended outer disc beyond a cavity, as is observed in\ntransition discs. This is mainly for numerical convenience, as it\nallows us to reduce the radial extent of the computational grid that\nsimulates the disc, and to focus on the dynamics of the gas and dust\nnear the vortex. In particular, the low densities at the disc edges\nminimize edge effects in the direct and indirect contributions to the\ndisc's gravitational potential \\citep{HPS92,Adams89}.\n\nThe simulations presented in this paper are summarised in\nTable~\\ref{tab:models}. In the simulations with gas self-gravity, the\ndisc gravitationally accelerates itself and the star, while in the\nsimulations without self-gravity, the disc only accelerates the\nstar. In all the simulations, the star remains at the origin of the\nreference frame, and the indirect terms that account for the\nacceleration of the star by the disc are therefore included in the\nequations of motion, regardless of whether self-gravity is included or\nnot. Our median value $\\Sigma_0 = 5\\times 10^{-3}$ corresponds to an\ninitial disc-to-star mass ratio of 1.7\\%. The Toomre parameter, $Q\n\\approx c_{\\rm s}\\Omega / \\pi G \\Sigma$, with $\\Omega$ the disc's\nangular frequency and $G$ the gravitational constant, is initially\nequal to 13, 5 and 2.5 at $r=r_0$ in models g2, g5 and g10,\nrespectively.\n% TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\n\\begin{table}\n  \\centering\n  \\caption{\\label{tab:models}Simulation models}\n  \\smallskip\n  \\begin{minipage}{\\hsize}\n    \\centering\n    \\begin{tabular}{l c r}\n      Name & Gas self-gravity & $\\Sigma_0$ [code units]\\\\\n      \\hline\n      \\hline\n      g0p2 & Yes & $0.2\\times10^{-3}$\\\\\n      g0p5 & Yes & $0.5\\times10^{-3}$\\\\\n      g2n & No & $2\\times10^{-3}$\\\\\n      g2 & Yes & $2\\times10^{-3}$\\\\\n      g5n & No & $5\\times10^{-3}$\\\\\n      g5 & Yes & $5\\times10^{-3}$\\\\\n      g10n & No & $10\\times 10^{-3}$\\\\\n      g10 & Yes & $10\\times10^{-3}$\\\\\n      \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\\par\n  \\end{minipage}\n\\end{table}\n% TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\n\nA small turbulent viscosity is included in the\nsimulations. Preliminary runs have shown that a constant alpha viscous\nparameter $\\alpha = 10^{-6}$ is a good compromise between a strong,\nlong-lived vortex \\citep[which requires low viscosities, particularly\nwith gas self-gravity as it inhibits the RWI;][]{GN88} and convergence\nwith increasing grid resolution (which would favour large\nviscosities).\n\nThe hydrodynamical equations are solved on a polar grid with $N_{\\rm\n  r} = 300$ cells logarithmically spaced between $r_{\\rm in}$ and\n$r_{\\rm out}$, and $N_{\\rm s} = 600$ sectors evenly spaced between\n$\\varphi=0$ and $2\\pi$. This grid resolution is sufficient for our\npurposes and helps maintain a tractable computational cost when\nincluding many dust particles.  Although the logarithmic radial\nspacing is only required for the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm in\nthe calculation of the gas self-gravity \\citep{BM08b}, it is also used\nwithout self-gravity to keep the same grid resolution in all\nsimulations. When self-gravity is included, a softening length\n$\\varepsilon = 0.3H(r)$ is used in the self-gravitating potential to\nmimic the effect of a finite vertical thickness. Standard outflow\n(zero-gradient) boundary conditions are used in the simulations.\n\n\n% --------------------------\n\\subsection{Dust}\n% --------------------------\n\\label{sec:model_pc}\nDust is modelled by Lagrangian particles that feel the star's gravity\n(direct and indirect acceleration terms), gas drag, but that do not\ninteract together (no dust self-gravity, no collisions nor growth). An\nimportant point is that when gas self-gravity is included, the\nparticles also feel the self-gravitating acceleration of the gas. It\nimplies that differences in the gas and dust velocities are only\nimparted by the pressure force felt by the gas.  We discard possibly\nimportant effects of dust feedback onto the gas\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{CZS15}.\n\nThe dust particles that we simulate are much smaller than the\nmolecular mean-free path in our disc models (see\nSection~\\ref{sec:codeunits}).  The drag force exerted by the gas\ntherefore corresponds to the so-called Epstein regime, and the\nparticles Stokes number (St), which is a dimensionless measure of the\nparticles stopping time (${\\tau_{\\rm s}} = {\\rm St}\\,\\Omega^{-1}$), is\ngiven by\n%\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\rm St} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{s \\rho_{\\rm pc}}{f_{\\rm D}\\Sigma_{\\rm gas}} \n\\approx \\frac{0.015}{f_{\\rm D}} \\times \n\\left(\\frac{s}{1{\\rm mm}}\\right)\n\\left(\\frac{\\rho_{\\rm pc}}{1{\\rm g\\;cm}^{-3}}\\right)\n\\left(\\frac{10{\\rm g\\;cm}^{-2}}{\\Sigma_{\\rm gas}}\\right)\n\\label{eq:St}\n\\end{equation}\n%\nwith $s$ the physical radius of the particles, $\\rho_{\\rm pc}$ their\ninternal mass density (we choose $\\rho_{\\rm pc} = 1$ g cm$^{-3}$),\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm gas}$ the gas surface density at the particles location,\nand $f_{\\rm D} = \\sqrt{1 + 9\\pi{\\cal M}^2/128}$ is a dimensionless\ncoefficient that features the Mach number of the dust relative to the\ngas, ${\\cal M} = |{\\bf v} - {\\bf v_{\\rm gas}}|/c_{\\rm s}$\n\\citep[][${\\bf v}$ and ${\\bf v_{\\rm gas}}$ denote the velocity vector\nof the dust and gas, respectively]{SJP07}. In practice $f_{\\rm D}\n\\approx 1$ in our simulations. We consider several particle sizes that\nare fixed in the simulations. Thus, the particles Stokes number does\nvary in the simulations according to the gas surface density at the\nparticles location. Stokes numbers typically range from\n$\\sim$$10^{-2}$ to $\\sim$$40$, which allows us to probe different\ntrapping efficiencies via gas drag.\n\nWe use 10,000 particles to simulate dust grains of a given size. Their\ninitial distribution is uniform between $r=0.8r_0$ and $1.2r_0$,\nunless otherwise stated. Their initial velocities are Keplerian,\nexcept in simulations with gas self-gravity, for which the initial\nazimuthal velocity of the particles includes the gas self-gravitating\nradial acceleration \\citep[much like in disc-planet simulations with\nself-gravity, see][]{BM08b}.  The number of dust particles may seem\nrather small but, as we will see in Section~\\ref{sec:results}, dust\nparticles quickly concentrate at well-defined locations in the disc,\neither at a single point inside or near the vortex, or along a ring\naround the vortex's radial location. We find 10,000 particles to be\nenough to describe the dust's azimuthal density distribution when it\nforms ring-like structures around the vortex's radial location.\n\nThe equations of motion for the dust particles are solved with a\nleapfrog integrator in polar coordinates. The integrator basically\ncorresponds to the 2D leapfrog integrator in cylindrical coordinates\nimplemented by \\cite{Zhu14} in the code ATHENA. We carried out the\nvarious tests described in the Appendix of \\cite{Zhu14} to validate\nour particle integrator. The particle integration scheme is\nparallelized with MPI using FARGO's domain decomposition into rings.\nThe timestep used in the integration of the dust particles is\nidentical to that used in the gas equations, it is therefore\nconstrained by the Courant-Frederichs-Levy (CFL) condition specific to\nFARGO. Test simulations using a fixed timestep, chosen to be shorter\nthan the minimum stopping time of the particles, showed negligible\nchanges to our results. In practice, the effective time step in our\nsimulations is shorter than the particles stopping time.\n\n\n% -------------------------- \n\\subsection{Conversion from code to physical units}\n% --------------------------\n\\label{sec:codeunits}\nAs mentioned in Section~\\ref{sec:model_gas}, the radial location $r_0$\nwhere the initial gas surface density is maximum defines the code's\nunit of length. The unit of mass is the mass of the central star, and\nthe unit of time is the Keplerian orbital period at $r=r_0$ divided by\n$2\\pi$. Whenever time is expressed in orbits, it refers to the orbital\nperiod at $r=r_0$, which we denote by $T_{\\rm orb}$.\n\nTo keep our results as general as possible, we do not specify physical\nunits of length and mass in the simulations, since the gas and dust\ndynamics are set by dimensionless numbers like the Toomre parameter,\nthe disc-to-star mass ratio or the particles Stokes number. All our\nresults are thus shown in code units, but it is very easy to convert\nthem into physical units. Assuming the mass unit is the Sun's mass and\nthe length unit is 65 AU, our median value for $\\Sigma_0$ of $5\\times\n10^{-3}$ corresponds to $\\approx$10 g cm$^{-2}$ and $T_{\\rm orb}\\sim$\n500 yrs.  For comparison, the gas surface density at the edge of the\n$\\sim$$70$ AU cavity in the J1604-2130 disc is estimated as $\\sim$10 g\ncm$^{-2}$, and that at the edge of the $\\sim$$45$ AU cavity in the\nLkCa 15 disc is $\\sim$60 g cm$^{-2}$ \\citep{vanderMarel2015}.\nConversion from Stokes number to dust size is via Eq.~(\\ref{eq:St}),\nusing $f_{\\rm D} = 1$. If, for example, dust grains have an internal\ndensity of 1 g cm$^{-3}$, and that the gas surface density at their\nlocation is 10 g cm$^{-2}$ (5$\\times 10^{-3}$ in code units), then St\n$=1$ particles correspond to $\\approx$ 6 cm grains. Using the same\nunits, the largest particles that we have simulated are a few metres\nin size, which remains much smaller than the minimum molecular mean\nfree path in our disc models ($\\sim$ 300 metres in models g10 and\ng10n) and justifies that the dust grains that we simulate are in the\nEpstein regime.\n\n\n% ===============\n\"), citations -> List{List{String(\"fargo1\")}, List{String(\"BM08a\"), String(\"\n  BM08b\")}, List{String(\"HPS92\"), String(\"Adams89\")}, List{String(\"GN88\")}, List{String(\"BM08b\")}, List{String(\"CZS15\")}, List{String(\"\\bf v\")}, List{String(\"BM08b\")}, List{String(\"vanderMarel2015\")}, List{}, List{}}}, convergence with grid resolution -> Map{text -> String(\"\n% ===============\n\\label{sec:conv}\nWe have carried out tests of convergence with increasing grid\nresolution for the non self-gravitating models g2n and g5n. Each model\nwas simulated with the same particle size, and with the number of grid\ncells in the radial times azimuthal directions increased from $200\n\\times 400$ to $500 \\times 1000$ for model g2n, and up to $600 \\times\n1200$ for model g5n. Results are displayed in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:conv}. For model g2n (upper panels) convergence in\nresolution is fairly good, with the particles shift angle and Stokes\nnumber varying by less than 10\\% between our nominal resolution\n($300\\times 600$) and maximum resolution. This fairly good convergence\nis not surprising since our gas model aims at producing a large-scale\nlopsided distribution in the gas surface density ($m=1$\nmode). Convergence is not excellent either. It is due to the fact that\nvortex inward migration occurs at a pace that slightly increases with\nincreasing resolution. Visual inspection at the gas density at\ndifferent resolutions points to a larger density contrast of the\nvortex waves with increasing resolution, which relates to a larger\nangular momentum flux extracted from the vortex and carried away by\nthe waves, and therefore faster inward migration (note again the\nanalogy with planetary migration). Increasing resolution therefore\ntends to strengthen the vortex and increase the gas density inside the\nvortex, which causes the particles Stokes number to slightly decrease,\nexplaining our results. This behaviour is also apparent in model g5n\nup to about 300 orbits, after which discrepancies with varying\nresolution are found to increase, due to the proximity of the vortex\nto the inner edge of the computational domain and the resulting\npartial reflection of waves at that location. Apart from when the\nvortex gets too close to the grid's inner edge, convergence with grid\nresolution is satisfactory and our results show that the moderate grid\nresolution adopted throughout this work is sufficient for our\npurposes.

Cartesian\ncoordinates $\\{x,y\\}$ are used with the star at the origin. To ease\nthe comparison between the models, the maximum in the gas surface\ndensity is set at $y=0$ in the panels.

The vortex's migration\nresults from an asymmetric wave emission by the vortex \\citep{PLP10}. \nVortex migration is therefore due to pressure\n  torques, not to gravitational torques, at least in the absence of\n  gas self-gravity. The waves emitted by the vortex cannot be seen in\nthe panels of Figure~\\ref{fig:g1n} because their density contrast\nrelative to the background disc is smaller than the vortex's, and\nbecause the radial profile of the gas density drops rapidly away from\nthe vortex's radial location. The wave that propagates inward from the\nvortex's radial location carries a negative flux of angular momentum\nand thus exerts a positive torque on the vortex. Conversely, the wave\nthat propagates outward from the vortex's radial location carries a\npositive flux of angular momentum and exerts a negative torque on the\nvortex.  In the absence of gas self-gravity, geometrical effects and\nthe radial gradient of surface density favour the outer wave, and the\nnet exchange of angular momentum between the vortex and the disc leads\nto inward migration of the vortex \\citep{PLP10}. We also notice that\nthe vortex strengthens during its inward migration with both the\nsurface density at the vortex centre and the azimuthal contrast in\nsurface density along the vortex increasing over time. At 300 orbits,\nthe surface density contrasts along the vortex are by factors of\nroughly 2.5, 12 and 25 in models g2n, g5n and g10n, respectively.\n\nThe location of the particles is marked by filled circles in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:g1n}, with different colours used for different\nparticle sizes. Recall that in the simulations the size of the\nparticles is fixed, but their Stokes number evolves with time\naccording to the gas surface density at the particles location (see\nEq.~\\ref{eq:St}).  The Stokes numbers shown in the lower-left corner\nin the panels are those at the particles location at 300 orbits. Since\ninitial Stokes numbers range from about 0.01 to 30, particles are\nquickly trapped inside the vortex as a result of gas drag. They\neventually concentrate at specific locations inside the vortex where a\nforce balance is reached between gas drag, the centrifugal force and\nthe star's gravity (direct and indirect terms; force balance is meant\nto be in the non-rotating frame centred onto the star). We find\nqualitatively the same trend as in \\cite{MC15}: while particles with\nSt $\\ll 1$ and $\\gg 1$ are trapped towards the vortex centre,\nparticles with St $\\sim 1$ are shifted ahead of the vortex centre in\nthe azimuthal direction. The orientations and relative amplitudes of\nthe aforementioned forces implies that the force balance for St $\\sim\n1$ particles is reached ahead of the vortex and not behind it\n\\citep[see the lower-right panel in figure 3 of][]{MC15}. We quantify\nthe azimuthal offset of the particles with respect to the vortex by\nmeasuring the azimuth of the particles relative to the location in the\nvortex where the gas surface density peaks. We call it the shift angle\nof a particle. At 300 orbits, the largest shift angles are about 20\ndegrees in model g2n for St $\\sim 4$, 23 degrees in model g5n for St\n$\\sim 2$, and 13 degrees in model g10n for St $\\sim 2$. Although quite\nsignificant, our maximum shift angles are smaller than in \\cite{MC15},\nwho found that St$=0.5$ particles could be shifted by as much as 45\ndegrees.  Comparison between our models, and with \\cite{MC15}, shows\nthat shift angles do not depend solely on the particles Stokes number\nbut also on the velocity differences between gas and dust, which are\nintimately related to the shape and strength of the vortex. We point\nout that the smallest shift angles are obtained in model g10n, which\nis the one that maximises the indirect term in the star acceleration\nby having the most massive, asymmetric and closest vortex. We also\nnote a tiny shift of the particles beyond the vortex centre in the\nradial direction.\n\n%FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\hsize]{f2a.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\hsize]{f2b.pdf}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:g1n_shift_ts}Time evolution of the particles shift\n  angle (left panel) and Stokes number (right panel) in model\n  g5n.

This\nis illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:g1n_shift_ts}, which displays the\ntime evolution of the particles shift angle (left panel) and Stokes\nnumber (right panel). We see that the Stokes numbers all decrease by\nabout 45\\% between 200 and 500 orbits, which is due to the increase in\nthe gas surface density during vortex migration (the vortex migrates\nfrom $r \\approx 0.72$ to $r \\approx 0.55$ between 200 and 500 orbits).\nVariations in the particles shift angle are not as straightforward to\nexplain. We observe that shift angles tend to decrease with time for\nparticles with St $\\lesssim1$, and to increase with time for St\n$\\gtrsim 2$. At the end of the simulation, St $\\sim 2$ particles reach\na shift angle $\\gtrsim 25$ degrees, which is the largest offset that\nwe have obtained over the duration of our simulations without\nself-gravity. Tests of convergence with varying grid resolution are\nprovided in Section~\\ref{sec:conv} of the Appendix.\n\nAs a brief summary of our results without self-gravity, we confirm the\nqualitative trend found by \\cite{MC15} that dust grains with Stokes\nnumber near unity are shifted azimuthally ahead of the horseshoe\ncentre. The particles' shift is therefore not specific to their model,\nwhere gas horseshoe streamlines result from a manually imposed\ncircular motion of the star about the system barycentre, and can be\nobtained self-consistently in hydrodynamical simulations of discs\nunstable against the RWI.\n\n\n% --------------------------\n\\subsection{Models with gas self-gravity}\n% --------------------------\n\\label{sec:w}\nFor models with self-gravity, the RWI takes longer to form a fully\ndeveloped vortex than in models without self-gravity. The amplitude of\nthe $m=1$ mode in the Fourier analysis of the gas surface density\npeaks at about 40, 60 and 50 orbits for models g2, g5 and g10,\nrespectively (it is about twice as long as in the models without\nself-gravity). Its stationary value is about twice as small with\nself-gravity than without, illustrating that gas self-gravity hinders\nthe RWI \\citep{GN88}.\n\nFor some of the models with self-gravity, the dust concentration is\nsensitive to the initial distribution of the particles, in particular\nwhether dust is introduced before or after the vortex forms\n(specifically, the ring-like structures formed by the dust grains in\nmodel g5, which will be shown in Section~\\ref{sec:g5}, tend to be\ndisrupted when particles are introduced before the vortex forms - they\nrather take the form of arc rings). However, when dust particles are\nintroduced after the vortex reaches a quasi-steady state, their\nconcentration shows overall marginal dependence on the initial\ndistribution. For comparison purposes, all simulations with\nself-gravity have been restarted at 250 orbits (long after the vortex\nforms) by introducing the particles between $r=1.2$ and 1.4 with a\nuniform distribution.\n\n\n%FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\hsize]{f4a.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\hsize]{f4b.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\hsize]{f4c.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\hsize]{f4d.pdf}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:ph}Results of simulations with large (typically\n  metre-sized) particles with model g2 (three leftmost panels) and\n  model g2n (right panel).

Results are shown with\npolar coordinates $\\{r,\\varphi\\}$ and the maximum in the gas surface\ndensity is set at $\\varphi=0$. For comparison, the results of model\ng2n (without self-gravity) are shown at the same time in the middle\npanel of Figure~\\ref{fig:g13_rf2}, using the same colour scale for the\ndensity contours (recall that, without self-gravity, particle\nconcentration is found to be independent of the initial particle\ndistribution).  We first see that vortex inward migration is much less\nrapid with self-gravity, and consequently the gas surface density in\nthe vortex is smaller with self-gravity at the same time.  Actually,\nthe vortex's shape and strength at 500 orbits in model g2 are,\noverall, very similar to those of model g2n at $\\sim$$130$ orbits (not\nshown here). A qualitative comparison of the two models at these times\nindicates that the density contrast in the vortex's spiral waves is\nsmaller with self-gravity, which is consistent with inward migration\nbeing slower in that case. A detailed interpretation for why gas\nself-gravity slows down the vortex's inward migration is beyond the\nscope of this paper. Part of it could be due to self-gravity\ninhibiting the RWI and thus weakening the vortex when the disc's\nsurface density near the vortex's location is large enough\n\\citep[][see also Paper I]{GN88}. It is also possible that gas\nself-gravity shifts the location of the vortex's Lindblad resonances\n(where the flow becomes supersonic relative to the vortex). By analogy\nwith the analytic study of \\cite{PH05} for planet-disc interactions,\ngas self-gravity would shift Lindblad resonances outward compared to\nthe situation where the vortex would migrate in a non self-gravitating\ndisc.  This would weaken the vortex's outer wave, strengthen the inner\nwave, and explain the slowing down of the migration (with some\nanalogy, again, with planet-disc interactions, see \\citealp{BM08b}).\n\nThe location of dust particles of various sizes is marked by filled\ncircles in the left and middle panels of Figure~\\ref{fig:g13_rf2}, and\ntheir instantaneous Stokes number is shown in the panels. For model g2\nagain, dust grains quickly converge to specific locations in the disc\nwhere a force balance is reached. However, particle concentration\noperates differently with gas self-gravity: the particles shift angle\nrelative to the vortex centre increases monotonically with Stokes\nnumber, ranging from $\\approx 0$ degrees for St $\\sim 0.02$ to\n$\\approx$ 90 degrees for St $\\sim 16$. As shown again in the middle\npanel of Figure~\\ref{fig:g13_rf2} for model g2n, shift angles without\nself-gravity increase with St up to St $\\sim 1$, and decrease to zero\nbeyond.  The comparison between models g2 and g2n is further\nhighlighted in the right panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:g13_rf2}, which\ndisplays the shift angle and Stokes number at 500 orbits with and\nwithout self-gravity.  We stress the rapid increase of the shift angle\nwith self-gravity when St $\\gtrsim 1$. This transition occurs for\nparticles of a few centimetres in size when using the set of physical\nunits given as example in Section~\\ref{sec:codeunits}. The location\nwhere particles concentrate in model g2 is found to be independent of\ntheir initial distribution (e.g., inside or outside the vortex's\nradial location), at least for the particle sizes shown in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:g13_rf2}. Larger particles than those shown in the\nfigure can display a different behaviour, which we describe below.\n\nTo get more insight into the behaviour of the largest particles with\ngas self-gravity, we show the evolution of particles 4 times larger\nthan the largest particles displayed in Figure~\\ref{fig:g13_rf2}.\nTheir physical radius is 2 metres using the set of physical units\ngiven in Section~\\ref{sec:codeunits}, and their initial distribution\nis again uniform between $r=1.2$ and 1.4. The time evolution of their\nlocation relative to the vortex is illustrated in the three leftmost\npanels in Figure~\\ref{fig:ph}. As particles drift in toward the\nvortex, they make a horseshoe U-turn ahead of the vortex centre\n(leftmost panel).  Later, particles go on to a second U-turn (outward\nthis time, second panel on the left). Because of gas drag, the second\nU-turn is closer to the vortex's radial location, but further away in\nthe azimuthal direction. Particles eventually drift toward their\nequilibrium location about 90-100 degrees ahead of the vortex (third\npanel). Gas streamlines, which are overplotted by white curves in the\npanels, recall that gas does not make horseshoe U-turns relative to\nthe vortex. So do not the smallest particles, which concentrate\ntowards the vortex centre. Gas streamlines also indicate that the\nequilibrium location of the largest particles is very close to the tip\nof the elliptical streamline that lies furthest from the vortex. The\nrightmost panel in Figure~\\ref{fig:ph} shows the result of the same\nsimulation without self-gravity, and it is clear that the large\nparticles drift toward the vortex centre upon adopting elliptical\ntrajectories relative to the vortex.\n\nThe horseshoe U-turns performed by large particles is most likely the\nconsequence of the particles feeling the self-gravitating acceleration\nof the gas and interacting with the vortex partly as if it was a\nmassive body. Like if it was a planet. Using the analogy with\ndisc-planet interactions, we interpret our results based on the\ncomparison between three timescales: (i) the timescale for dust\nparticles to drift across the half-width of the vortex's horseshoe\nregion ($\\tau_{\\rm drift}$), (ii) the timescale for particles to make\na U-turn relative to the vortex ($\\tau_{\\rm U-turn}$), and (iii) the\ntimescale for particles to complete a full horseshoe orbit relative to\nthe vortex (libration timescale, $\\tau_{\\rm lib} >\n  \\tau_{\\rm U-turn}$). When $\\tau_{\\rm drift} \\leq \\tau_{\\rm\n  U-turn}$, gas drag prevents dust particles from making horseshoe\nU-turns, and dust drifts towards the vortex's centre much like when\nself-gravity is discarded. When $\\tau_{\\rm lib} > \\tau_{\\rm drift} \n\\gtrsim \\tau_{\\rm U-turn}$, dust particles can\nembark on, but not complete, horseshoe\ntrajectories. Gas drag still acts to damp the relative velocity\nbetween dust and gas, and particles thus progressively concentrate at\nor near the vortex's radial location (as can be seen in the two middle\npanels in Figure~\\ref{fig:ph}). When $\\tau_{\\rm drift} \\gg \\tau_{\\rm\n  lib}$, that is when the drag force is much smaller than the\neffective gravitational force from the vortex, particles should\nundergo horseshoe orbits very similar to those a nearly inviscid gas\nwould adopt in the presence of a planet. This is shown in the limit of\nfully decoupled particles ($\\tau_{\\rm drift} \\rightarrow \\infty$) in\nSection~\\ref{sec:pinf} of the Appendix.\n\nThe particle Stokes number for which $\\tau_{\\rm drift} \\gtrsim\n\\tau_{\\rm U-turn}$, and for which dust can embark on horseshoe U-turns\nrelative to the vortex, can be estimated as follows.  We have\n$\\tau_{\\rm drift} = x_{\\rm s} / |v_{\\rm r,dust}|$ with $x_{\\rm s}$ the\nhalf-width of the vortex's horseshoe region and $v_{\\rm r,dust}$ the\nparticle radial velocity. In a 1D isothermal gas disc, and neglecting\nthe contribution of gas self-gravity to the azimuthal velocities of\nthe gas and dust, $v_{\\rm r,dust}$ is given by\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{TakeuchiLin02}\n\\begin{equation}\nv_{\\rm r,dust} = \\frac{1}{1+{\\rm St}^2} \\left( \nv_{\\rm r,gas} + h^2 v_{\\rm K} {\\rm St} \\frac{\\partial\\log\\Sigma}{\\partial\\log r}\n\\right),\n\\label{eq:vrdust}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $v_{\\rm r,gas}$ is the radial velocity of the gas and $v_{\\rm\n  K}$ is the Keplerian velocity. All quantities in\nEq.~(\\ref{eq:vrdust}) should be evaluated at the separatrices of the\nvortex's horseshoe region (that is, at $r = r_{\\rm v} \\pm x_{\\rm s}$,\nwith $r_{\\rm v}$ the vortex's radial location). Progress can be made\nby considering the 2D structure of the vortex. For model g2, our\nnumerical simulations show that $v_{\\rm r,gas}$ is fairly well\napproximated by\n\\begin{equation}\nv_{\\rm r,gas} = -\\frac{5h^2}{2} v_{\\rm K} \\frac{\\partial\\log\\Sigma}{\\partial\\varphi}, \n\\end{equation}\nwhich is actually 5 times the first-order correction for the gas\nradial velocity to maintain a geostrophic flow about the vortex\n(balance between Coriolis and pressure forces; see, e.g., equation 16\nin \\citealp{MC15}). The difference accounts for the zero-order radial\nvelocity of the gas. We then find that $v_{\\rm r,gas}(r = r_{\\rm v}\n\\pm x_{\\rm s}) \\approx \\pm h^2 v_{\\rm K}$, with $v_{\\rm r,gas}(r =\nr_{\\rm v} - x_{\\rm s})$ evaluated behind the vortex in the azimuthal\ndirection (where outward U-turns occur), and similarly $v_{\\rm\n  r,gas}(r = r_{\\rm v} + x_{\\rm s})$ is evaluated ahead of the vortex\nin the azimuthal direction (where inward U-turns occur). The radial\ndensity profile of the gas being weakly altered by the vortex's\nformation, the last term in the bracket in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:vrdust}) can\nbe calculated with the initial surface density profile, which gives\n$\\partial\\log\\Sigma / \\partial\\log r (r = r_{\\rm v} \\pm x_{\\rm s}) =\n\\mp r_{\\rm v} x_{\\rm s} / 4H^2$. Eq.~(\\ref{eq:vrdust}) can finally be\nrecast as\n\\begin{equation}\nv_{\\rm r,dust}(r = r_{\\rm v} \\pm x_{\\rm s}) = \\frac{v_{\\rm K}}{1+{\\rm St}^2} \\left( \n\\pm h^2\n\\mp \\frac{{\\rm St}}{4} \\frac{x_{\\rm s}}{r_{\\rm v}} \n\\right).\n\\label{eq:vrdust2}\n\\end{equation}\nWe first note that, for dust horseshoe U-turns to be possible, we need\n$v_{\\rm r,dust}(r = r_{\\rm v} - x_{\\rm s}) > 0$ (outward U-turn) and\n$v_{\\rm r,dust}(r = r_{\\rm v} + x_{\\rm s}) < 0$ (inward U-turn), which\nimplies ${\\rm St} > 4h^2 r_{\\rm v}/x_{\\rm s}$.  For the vortex in\nmodel g2, $x_{\\rm s} / r_{\\rm v} \\approx 0.04$ and above inequality\nbecomes St $\\gtrsim 1$. From our numerical simulations, we find\n$\\tau_{\\rm U-turn} \\sim (2-3)\\times T_{\\rm orb}$\nwhich, as expected, is a small fraction of $\\tau_{\\rm lib}$\n($\\tau_{\\rm lib} = 8\\pi r_{\\rm v} / 3\\Omega x_{\\rm s} \\approx 35\nT_{\\rm orb}$). Using Eq.~(\\ref{eq:vrdust2}), we finally find that\n$\\tau_{\\rm drift} \\gtrsim \\tau_{\\rm U-turn}$ for St $\\gtrsim 2-4$. It\nis in good agreement with the range of Stokes numbers from which gas\nself-gravity considerably increases the particle shift angle in model\ng2 (see right panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:g13_rf2}).\n\nFor completeness, we mention that the same self-gravitating simulation\nas shown in the three leftmost panels in Figure~\\ref{fig:ph}, but\nwhere particles are placed initially between $r=0.5$ and 0.7, result\nin the particles concentrating both ahead (at $\\sim$$100$ degrees) and\nbehind (at $\\sim$$-100$ degrees) the vortex centre. This shows that\nthe concentration of the largest particles, either far ahead of far\nbehind the vortex, depends on the relative flow between the dust and\nthe vortex, that is on the initial location of the particles (inside\nor outside the vortex's radial location), as well as the direction of\nvortex migration (not shown here). We point out again the analogy with\ndisc-planet interactions, where gas drifting relative to a low-mass\nplanet -- because the planet migrates and/or the gas drifts viscously\n-- can be trapped ahead or behind the planet \\citep{masset02, SJP14,\n  Pierens15}. We also stress the analogy with the\n  trapping of solid particles on tadpole orbits around a planet in the\n  presence of gas drag \\citep[e.g.,][]{Peale93, Lyra09}. The\n  equilibrium location of solid particles ahead or behind the planet\n  depends on the planet's mass and on the particle size, and,\n  interestingly, the maximum shift angle of solid particles ahead of a\n  planet is 108 degrees \\citep{Peale93}, which is very close to the\n  maximum shift angle that we find for a self-gravitating vortex.\n  \nAs a brief summary of our results for model g2, we find that gas\nself-gravity controls the dynamics of large particles, whereas gas\ndrag determines the dynamics of small particles.  Self-gravity allows\nthe largest particles to concentrate far ahead of the vortex (or far\nbehind it) upon adopting horseshoe U-turns. Gas drag prevents small\nparticles from taking the U-turns. The transition between what could\nbe called a gas drag-dominated regime and a self-gravity-dominated\nregime occurs quite neatly around St $\\approx 1$ for model\ng2. However, the Stokes number at this transition likely depends on\nthe disc mass. For example, in a disc with lower gas surface density\nnear the vortex's radial location, the magnitude of the drag force\nwill be approximately the same for a given Stokes number\n(approximately since the vortex's shape and strength may vary with the\ndisc's surface density), but the gravitational force from the vortex\nwill be smaller since the vortex is less massive. Results of\nsimulations at lower gas surface densities will be presented at the\nbeginning of Section~\\ref{sec:synthetic}, which indicate that the\ntransition between the gas drag and self-gravity dominated regimes\noccurs around a critical particle size.\n\n% -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - \n\\subsubsection{Results of model g5}\n% -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - \n\\label{sec:g5}\n%FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=0.47\\hsize]{f5a.pdf}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.47\\hsize]{f5b.pdf}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:g1_rf2}Results of model g5 at 500 orbits.

We see that both the gas structure and the dust\ndistribution are markedly different from those of model g2, while the\ninitial gas densities differ by only a factor of 2.5 between both\nmodels (compare with the left panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:g13_rf2}). In\nmodel g5, the vortex is more elongated along the azimuthal direction\nand the density contrast is about 20\\%. For comparison, in model g2\nthe density contrast along the vortex is by a factor of\n$\\sim$$2$. Furthermore, in model g5 the gas density maximum in the\nvortex is still very close to $r = 1$, indicating that the vortex has\nnot migrated over the duration of the simulation. This is supported by\na detailed inspection at the gas density which shows marginal\nexcitation of density waves by the vortex compared to model g2. Also,\nwe notice that the radial location where elliptical streamlines are\ncentred in the frame rotating at the vortex's pattern frequency, which\ndefines the vortex's corotation radius, is shifted outward from the\nvortex's radial location (defined as the radial location where the gas\nsurface density peaks).  This shows that the vortex's pattern\nfrequency is slower than the Keplerian frequency (Paper I). This slow\npattern frequency is probably the reason why the vortex emits no or\nvery little spiral density waves in the disc. The slow pattern\nfrequency also directly impacts the particles distribution. Most of\nthe small particles get trapped onto the elliptical streamlines in the\nrotating frame and progressively drift toward the centre of the set of\nelliptical streamlines (which actually corresponds to a minimum in the\ngas potential vorticity or vortensity). This is what we obtain for the\nSt $\\sim$ 0.01 particles (see the single blue dot at $r \\approx$ 1.12\nin the left panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:g1_rf2}).  Note, however, that\nsome of the St $\\sim$ 0.01 particles form a ring-like structure around\nthe vortex's radial location at $r \\approx$ 1.\n\nLarger particles decouple from the gas and are not tied to the\nelliptical streamlines: they converge toward the pressure maximum\nlocated at $r \\approx$ 1. They also form ring-like structures, though\nthe left panel in Figure~\\ref{fig:g1_rf2} does not hint at the\nparticles azimuthal distribution. The latter is shown as an histogram\nin the right panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:g1_rf2}, with large bins used to\nsmooth high spatial frequency fluctuations (the y-values in the\nhistogram are simply the fraction of the total number of particles in\neach bin). Azimuths are relative to the vortex centre.  More than half\nof the smallest (St $\\sim$ 0.01) particles are at $\\varphi \\sim$ 0,\nwith the vast majority of them at the centre of the elliptical\nstreamlines. Larger particles show quite distinct azimuthal\ndistributions.  St $\\sim$ 0.1 particles have a lopsided distribution\nthat peaks slightly ahead of the vortex. The fact it peaks ahead of\nthe vortex is just a coincidence: since St $\\sim$ 0.1 particles and\nthe vortex move at different speeds, the azimuth at which the\nparticles' azimuthal distribution peaks varies with time. Finally,\nwhile St $\\sim$ 1 particles have a nearly flat azimuthal distribution,\nSt $\\sim$ 10 particles feature a periodic pattern of azimuthal\nwavenumber $m=6$. The reason for this particular pattern is unknown,\nbut resembles that of the St $\\sim$ 0.01 particles located around the\nvortex's radial location.  We find the same pattern when adopting a\nslightly different initial distribution (uniform in $r \\in\n[0.8-1.2]$). We also comment that the vortex's corotation radius\nbecomes less shifted as grid resolution is increased. It is located at\n$r \\approx 1.05$ for a grid resolution increased to $600\\times 1000$,\ncompared to $r \\approx 1.12$ for our nominal resolution of $300\\times\n600$.

By doing this we expect to see a smooth\ntransition in the concentration of the large dust grains from\nring-like structures (as in model g5) to point-like structures (as in\nmodel g2). Specifically, as in \\cite{BP13} we adopt a simple\nexponential decay of the density profile by solving $\\partial_t \\Sigma\n= -(\\overline{\\Sigma} - \\Sigma_{\\rm target})/\\tau$ alongside the\nhydrodynamical equations, with $\\overline{\\Sigma}$ the\nazimuthally-averaged density profile at restart time, $\\Sigma_{\\rm\n  target} = 10^{-3}\\overline{\\Sigma}$ an arbitrarily small density\nprofile that we take to be not zero for numerical convenience, and\n$\\tau$ is chosen to be 300 orbits. In practice, the axisymmetric\nprofile of gas density is decreased by a factor $\\sim$10 in about 700\norbits after the restart. The results of this simulation are displayed\nat four different times in Figure~\\ref{fig:g1r}, where the Stokes\nnumbers shown in the panel are averaged in space (they increase with\ntime as the gas surface density decreases). The first panel from the\nleft is at 700 orbits (350 orbits after the restart).  Interestingly,\nthe gas density profile now takes smaller values than in model g2, yet\nboth the gas and the dust distributions are very similar to those of\nmodel g5 prior to the restart. We note a few differences, though.\nFirst, the centre of the gas elliptical streamlines in the rotating\nframe is slightly closer to the vortex's centre (its radial location\nhas decreased from $r \\approx 1.12$ to $r \\approx 1.08$). Second and\nprobably related point, the smallest particles that are located around\nthe vortex's radial location now form a disrupted ring (see the\ndark-blue dots in the panel). In the second panel (at 860 orbits), the\ncentre of the elliptical streamlines has become close enough to the\nvortex centre to significantly perturb the smallest particles, which\nbecome trapped onto elliptical streamlines. In the third panel (1040\norbits), the centre of the elliptical streamlines now coincides with\nthe vortex centre, which indicates that the vortex's pattern frequency\nis now very close to the Keplerian frequency.  In addition, the vortex\nis now less elongated along the azimuthal direction (the density\ncontrast along the vortex increases) and it has started to migrate\ninward (the vortex's radial location has decreased from $r \\approx 1$\nto $\\approx 0.92$ from 860 to 1040 orbits). Particles with the two\nsmallest sizes now have point-like distributions (dark-blue and cyan\ndots in the panel), while the largest particles are getting trapped\nmuch ahead of the vortex. In the fourth panel (1270 orbits) particles\nhave point-like distributions which are very close to those shown in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:g13_rf2} for model g2.\n\nBefore closing this subsection, we come back to the evolution of the\nvortex's pattern frequency with gas self-gravity. We have seen that,\nwith increasing strength of self-gravity, the radial location where\nthe gas potential vorticity is minimum (the vortex's corotation\nradius) shifts outward from the radial location where the gas density\npeaks (which we have defined throughout this study as the vortex's\nradial location). This is further illustrated and quantified in the\nleft panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:vps} for the restart simulation with\nmodel g5 where the gas density decreases over time. We have calculated\nthe vortex's pattern frequency by measuring the angle through which\nthe density maximum rotates over time (it is the same angle as that\nthrough which the minimum potential vorticity rotates over time). The\ntime evolution of the vortex's pattern frequency is displayed in the\nright panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:vps}. Dashed curves show the Keplerian\nfrequency at the radial location where the gas density is maximum (in\nblack) and where the potential vorticity (vortensity) is maximum (in\nred). The vortex's pattern frequency nearly equals the Keplerian\nfrequency at the radial location of the vortensity minimum, as\nexpected, and catches up with the Keplerian frequency at the density\nmaximum as the strength of self-gravity decreases.\n\n\n\n% -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - \n\\subsubsection{Results of model g10}\n% -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - \n\\label{sec:g10}\nThe results of model g10 are displayed in Figure~\\ref{fig:g10_rf2} at\n500 orbits. Overall, the gas and dust distributions are similar to\nthose of model g5 at the same time (compare with\nFigure~\\ref{fig:g1_rf2}). The smallest particles also tend to\nconcentrate at the centre of the elliptical streamlines located at the\nvortex's corotation radius. The latter is shifted further outside the\nvortex's radial location compared to model g5 (the vortex's corotation\nradius is at $r \\approx 1.2$ for model g10 and at $r \\approx 1.12$ for\nmodel g5). This goes along the trend illustrated at the end of the\nprevious subsection that the larger the disc mass (that is, the\nstronger self-gravity), the slower is the vortex's pattern frequency\ncompared to the Keplerian frequency. Larger particles concentrate\nalong rings with different azimuthal structures depending on the\nparticle size (and thus Stokes number). Figure~\\ref{fig:g10_rf2} also\ndisplays the results of model g10 with a grid resolution increased\nfrom $300\\times600$ to $600\\times1000$ (middle panel, filled circles\nin the right panel). Results at both resolutions are in fairly good\nagreement.  The vortex's corotation radius decreases from $r \\approx\n1.2$ at a resolution of $300\\times600$ to $r \\approx 1.18$ at a\nresolution of $600\\times1000$. Convergence in resolution is much\nbetter than for model g5, which suggests that the transition to the\nregime where self-gravity renders the vortex's pattern frequency\nsub-Keplerian is very sensitive to grid resolution.\n%FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.83\\hsize]{f9.pdf}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:depth} Shift angle relative to the vortex centre\n  for various particle sizes in models g2, g0p5 and g0p2.

We have shown this behaviour to\nbe related to horseshoe U-turns performed by the large particles\nrelative to the vortex before they drift to their equilibrium location\nthrough gas drag.  In this section, we report the results of a\nsimulation with model g2 and fully decoupled dust particles. At 250\norbits, we restarted the simulation by introducing 100 000 particles\nwith a sharply decreasing radial distribution in\n$r\\in[0.9-1]$. Results are displayed in Figure~\\ref{fig:pinf} at 21\norbits after the restart (upper panels) and 527 orbits after (lower\npanels). While the left panels help locate the particles relative to\nthe vortex, the right panels display the dust's density distribution,\nwhich we simply calculate as the number of particles per grid\ncell. The upper-right panel is strongly suggestive that the particles\nnumber density is advected inside what already appears as the vortex's\nhorseshoe region. In comparison, in the lower panels the vortex has\nslightly migrated inward, with two notable consequences: (i) the dust\ndensity is nearly uniform in the distinct horseshoe region of the\nvortex, and (ii) the region of highest dust density, which is\ninitially inside the vortex's orbit, ends up circulating relative to\nthe vortex beyond its horseshoe region. These results are analogous to\nthe advection of gas potential vorticity and/or entropy in the\npresence of a low-mass planet \\citep[e.g.,][]{BaruteauPP6}.\n\nIn the lower panels of Figure~\\ref{fig:pinf}, the full width of the\nvortex's horseshoe region is $\\approx 0.07$. Although the vortex is\nnot a point mass, it is instructive to compare its horseshoe width to\nthat expected for a planet with the same mass. We\n  estimate the mass of the vortex ($m_{\\rm v}$) as the mass between $r\n  = 0.84$ and $r=0.95$, $\\varphi = \\pm \\pi/4$, and having uniform\n  surface density $\\approx 3\\times 10^{-3}$ in code units (see\n  lower-left panel in Figure~\\ref{fig:pinf}).  We obtain $m_{\\rm v}\n  \\approx 4.6\\times10^{-4}M_{\\star}$. In the circular restricted\n  three-body problem, the maximum full width of the horseshoe region\n  of a planet with mass $m_{\\rm v}$ and orbital distance $r_{\\rm v}$\n  is $2\\sqrt{12}\\times r_{\\rm v}(m_{\\rm v}/3M_{\\star})^{1/3}$\n  \\citep{MurrayDermottBook}, which amounts here to $\\approx 0.33$.\n  Using three-body integrations, we find that the maximum full width\n  for test particles to undergo periodic horseshoe trajectories with a\n  small epicyclic motion is $\\approx 0.10$, which is about twice the\n  planet's Hill radius ($2r_{\\rm v} ( m_{\\rm v}/\n  3M_{\\star})^{1/3}$). Finally, the maximum full width of the planet's\n  horseshoe region in the gas with same aspect ratio ($h = 0.1$) and\n  same viscosity as in the simulations presented throughout this study\n  is $\\approx 0.14$. Not surprisingly, the width of the vortex's\n  horseshoe region is smaller than all above estimates for a planet\n  with the same mass as the vortex's. We note that, since $m_{\\rm v} /\n  M_{\\star} \\lesssim h^3$, the planet's horseshoe width in the gas\n  scales as $\\sqrt{m_{\\rm v}}$ \\citep[e.g.,][]{mak2006}, which\n  indicates that the vortex's horseshoe width in the simulation shown\n  in Figure~\\ref{fig:pinf} is very similar to that of the gas around a\n  planet of mass $m_{\\rm v}/4 \\approx 10^{-4}M_{\\star}$.\n\n% AAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\"), citations -> List{List{String(\"BaruteauPP6\")}, List{String(\"MurrayDermottBook\")}, List{String(\"mak2006\")}, List{}, List{}}}, introduction -> Map{text -> String(\"\n% ===============\n\\label{sec:intro}\nTransition discs are protoplanetary discs around young (1-10 Myr)\nstars with little or no emission in the near- and mid-IR but strong\nemission at longer wavelengths \\citep[see the review\nby][]{Espaillat14}. Modeling of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)\nof transition discs implies that their inner parts form dust cavities\nlargely devoid of small dust grains, followed by cold dust populating\nan outer disc. Interferometric imaging shows that the cavities also\nhave a deficit in (sub-)mm continuum emission and are mostly devoid of\nlarge dust grains. Cavities typically span a few tens of Astronomical\nUnits (AU) like in LkCa 15 \\citep[$\\sim$50 AU;][]{Andrews11} and AB\nAur \\citep[$\\gtrsim$70 AU;][]{Pietu05}, with minimum and maximum sizes\nso far in TW Hya \\citep[$\\sim$4 AU;][]{Hughes07} and HD 142527\n\\citep[$\\sim$140 AU;][]{Casassus13,Avenhaus14}. A subset of transition\ndiscs shows significant near-IR excesses. These so-called\npre-transition discs feature an optically thick inner disc of\ntypically $\\sim$1 AU between the star and the cavity, and some of them\nhave accretion rates exceeding a few $\\times 10^{-8} M_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm\n  yr}^{-1}$ \\citep[][and references therein]{Espaillat14}. There is\ngrowing observational evidence that gas is present in the dust\ncavities of (pre-)transition discs, though at a reduced level compared\nto the outer disc \\citep{Carmona14,Bruderer14}.  The decrease in gas\nsurface density inside the cavity varies from 1 to 4 orders of\nmagnitude \\citep{vanderMarel2015}.\n\nSeveral origins for the diversity of cavity sizes and accretion rates\nhave been explored. One is grain growth and the consequent decrease in\nthe dust emissivity: cavities would be only apparent. In the inner\ndisc, however, grain growth is shown to be limited by destructive\ncollisions to mm/cm particles, which should be detected in the\nsub-mm. It therefore appears difficult for fragmentation-limited grain\ngrowth to simultaneously account for the near-IR dip in the SED of\ntransition discs and their deficit in sub-mm continuum emission\n\\citep{Birnstiel2012}. Alternatively, large dust and gas cavities\ncould be cleared via photoevaporative winds. A broad range of\naccretion rates is expected depending on the level of high-energy\nstellar radiation (extreme UV and X-Ray), consistent with the\ndiversity of accretion rates observed in transition discs \\citep[see\nthe review by][]{AlexanderPP6}. However, current models of\nphoto-evaporation cannot account for discs with both large cavities\n($\\gtrsim 10$ AU) and substantial accretion rates \\citep[$\\gtrsim\n10^{-9} M_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$;][]{Owen11}, nor discs with moderate\ndrops in the gas surface density within the cavity.\n\nA third mechanism for sculpting the cavities of transition discs is\ndynamical clearing by one or several companions.  These can be stellar\ncompanions. For example, \\cite{Casassus15b} describe how a highly\nmutually inclined stellar companion to HD 142527 can generate the fast\nradial flows inside the cavity of its transition disc\n\\citep{Rosenfeld14}. These fast radial flows could explain how disc\nholes could be simultaneously transparent and still contain material\nthat accretes at rates $\\gtrsim 10^{-9} M_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$\n\\citep{Rosenfeld14}. Companions can also be planets. The salient point\nis that the size of the gap opened by a massive planet differs in the\ngas and in the dust. Gaps in the gas are narrow. For example, for a\nJupiter-mass planet orbiting a Solar-mass star, the half-width of the\ngap does not exceed $\\sim$40$\\%$ of the star-planet separation, even\nin discs with very low turbulent activity \\citep{crida06}. Gaps in the\ndust depend on the size of the dust particles or, more generally, on\nthe coupling between dust and gas (quantified by the Stokes number,\nsee Section~\\ref{sec:model_pc}).  Dust grains up to few tens of\nmicrons are tied to the gas, so the width of their gap is basically\nthe same as the gas \\citep{pm04,Fouchet07,Zhu12}.  Dust in the mm/cm\nrange, however, is not tied to the gas and drifts generally inward as\na result of gas friction. Radial drift can, however, stall at\nlocations known as dust traps where the gas pressure is maximum\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{Pinilla12,JohansenPP6}. Simulations of disc-planet\ninteractions show that the outer edge of a planet gap is generally a\nrobust pressure maximum while the inner edge is not: large dust grains\ninitially beyond the planet's orbit can be trapped efficiently at the\ngap's outer edge while the large dust grains initially inside the\nplanet's orbit migrate inward \\citep[e.g.,][]{Zhu12,Zhu14}. This\nimplies that a single massive planet could simultaneously carve a\nlarge cavity in mm-grains and a narrow gap in $\\mu$m-grains, with\ntherefore no or limited impact on the accretion rate. Large cavities\nin $\\mu$m-grains and strong reductions in the accretion rate are not\nnatural outcomes of disc-planet interactions, though they can be\nobtained by invoking several massive planets in the disc\n\\citep{Zhu11}.\n\nRecent high-resolution interferometric imaging (especially with ALMA)\nhas highlighted that the mm emission rings of transition discs are\noften non-axisymmetric. Several of them feature large-scale lopsided\nstructures with distinct crescent or horseshoe shapes. These include\nHD 142527 \\citep{Casassus13,Fukagawa14}, Oph IRS 48\n\\citep{vanderMarel13}, AB Aur \\citep{Tang12}, SR21\n\\citep{Andrews11all,Perez14}, LkH$\\alpha$ 330 \\citep{Isella13} and HD\n135344B \\citep{Brown09,Perez14}.  Intensity variations along the\nlopsided rings are by factors of $\\sim$2-3 for SR21, LkH$\\alpha$, AB\nAur and HD 135344B, $\\sim$30 for HD 142527 and $>$100 for Oph IRS\n48. In contrast, the gas emission is generally more symmetric along\nthe lopsided rings \\citep{vanDishoeck2015}. These findings are so far\nbest explained by the presence of a long-lived vortex in the gas that\nwould efficiently trap mm-grains.\n\nProbably the most promising vortex-forming instability in the context\nof lopsided transition discs is the Rossby-Wave Instability\n\\citep[RWI,][]{lovelace99}. It is essentially the form of the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability in a differentially rotating disc, and a\nthin-disc version of the Papaloizou-Pringle instability\n\\citep{PP84}. It is a linear instability associated with a radial\nminimum in the gas potential vorticity which, in practice, can be\ntriggered where the pressure has a radial maximum. This may occur (i)\nnear the disc's centrifugal radius due to mass infall from the\nprotostellar cloud \\citep{Bae15}, (ii) at the outer edge of a\ngap-opening planet \\citep[e.g.,][]{Lyra09,LinMK12}, (iii) at the edges\nbetween magnetically active and inactive (dead) regions\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{VT06,Regaly12,Faure14,Lyra15,Flock15}, or (iv) at the\nedge of a disc undergoing photo-evaporation, though to our knowledge\nthis latter scenario has not been examined yet. The planet gap\nscenario has received the most attention, but detailed modeling is\nstill needed to reproduce observed distributions of gas and dust, like\nin the Oph IRS 48 disc \\citep{ZhuStone14}. The dead/active regions\nscenario needs more exploration, in particular to determine the\nefficiency of non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic effects at suppressing\nthe magneto-rotational instability in the outer regions of transition\ndiscs \\citep{Lesur14,Bai15,Gressel15}.\n\nAnother route to producing lopsided dust rings in transition discs has\nbeen recently examined by \\cite{MC15}. The authors proposed a model\nwhere a massive gas disc exhibits a mode with azimuthal wavenumber\n$m=1$ and pattern frequency comparable to the disc's Keplerian\nfrequency. Mutual gravitational interactions will cause the star and\ndisc to rotate about their centre-of-mass, which, if the disc is\nmassive enough, can sustain an $m=1$ perturbation where the gas\ndescribes horseshoe-shaped streamlines. Interestingly, \\cite{MC15}\nfound that dust grains with Stokes numbers around unity, that is with\naerodynamic stopping times around the orbital period, are not trapped\nat the horseshoe centre: they are shifted azimuthally by up to 45\ndegrees ahead of the horseshoe centre. These should be mm/cm-grains\ndepending on the gas surface density at the vortex's radial location,\nthus a significant shift of the grains location relative to the\nhorseshoe centre should be detectable via high-resolution\ninterferometry in the (sub-)mm.\n\nNonetheless, \\cite{MC15} left un-addressed several important issues.\nThey envisioned an $m=1$ mode based on the mutual interaction between\nthe lopsided disc and the star, but the trigger was not specified. We\npropose that it could be the RWI. Also, gas self-gravity was discarded\nalthough its acceleration can be as important as, if not larger than,\nthe indirect acceleration imparted by the star.  This we show in an\naccompanying paper (Zhu \\& Baruteau, submitted, hereafter Paper I),\nwhere we present results of hydrodynamic simulations with and without\ngas self-gravity, with lopsided gas distributions mediated by the\nRWI. While Paper I deals with gas only, the present paper presents\nresults of simulations with both gas and dust to investigate the\nconcentration of dust grains when varying the mass of the gas disc,\nwith a focus on large disc masses for which gas self-gravity should\nmatter most. The model set-up is described in\nSection~\\ref{sec:setup}. Results of simulations are presented in\nSection~\\ref{sec:results}, first without gas self-gravity in\nSection~\\ref{sec:wo}, then with self-gravity in\nSection~\\ref{sec:w}. These results are used to generate synthetic\nimages of dust continuum observations, which are presented in\nSection~\\ref{sec:synthetic}.
