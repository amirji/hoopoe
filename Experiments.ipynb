      "[\"\\n%================================================\\nPlanets beyond a few Earth masses can generate a partial gap around their orbit in the disc of gas and dust in which they form. Depending on the disc's temperature and turbulent viscosity, a pressure bump can build up at the outer edge of this gap \\\\citep[e.g.,][]{Crida_etal2006,2006A&A...459L..17P,2015ApJ...807L..11D}. Several studies have shown that for a planet on a circular orbit, this pressure bump can act as a barrier against the radial drift of solids marginally coupled to the disc gas, thereby halting their accretion on the planet \\\\citep{2012A&A...546A..18M,Lambrechts_etal2014,2014A&A...572A.107L,2017AJ....153..222B,Ataiee_etal2018,Bitsch_etal2018}. Such solids have a size comparable to that of pebbles, and the critical mass that a planet needs to reach before it gets completely isolated from surrounding pebbles in the disc is called the pebble isolation mass (PIM).\\n\\nSince the PIM depends on the effective trapping of pebbles around a pressure bump outside the planet orbit, previous studies have examined its dependence on the aspect ratio $h$ and the $\\\\alpha$ turbulent viscosity of the disc gas, as well as on the Stokes number ($St$) of the solids. The effect of the planet eccentricity ($e$) on the PIM has not been previously addressed, which is yet of importance for planet formation and evolution models \\\\citep[][]{PMID:26289203,2019A&A...627A..83L,2019A&A...623A..88B,2020A&A...643A..66B,2021A&A...650A.116M,Izidoro21}. It also has a strong observational motivation. While the mass distribution of planets in observed close-in planetary systems could be accounted for by the disc's thermal mass \\\\citep[][]{2019ApJ...874...91W} or the PIM \\\\citep[][]{2019A&A...630A..51B}, most of these planets actually have slightly eccentric orbits \\\\citep[][]{2011arXiv1109.2497M,2011ApJS..197....8L,2012ApJ...758...39J,2012ApJ...761...92F,2016PNAS..11311431X,2018ApJ...860..101Z} which naturally leads to wonder whether and how the PIM differs for eccentric planets. For a protoplanetary core on an eccentric orbit, \\\\citet{LO2018} found that the pebble accretion efficiency first increases with $e$ once $e$ becomes of the order the absolute value of the dimensionless radial pressure gradient $\\\\abs{\\\\eta} = (h^2/2) \\\\abs{ \\\\partial\\\\log P / \\\\partial\\\\log r }$. However, when $e$ exceeds a few percent typically, that is of order $h$, the high relative velocity between the planet and pebbles precludes pebble accretion, whose efficiency drops quickly. \\n\\nAlthough previous studies have shown that the eccentricity of a planet can be dampened by the interactions with the gas disc \\\\citep[][]{2008A&A...482..677C,2010A&A...523A..30B}, several mechanisms can grow and maintain a substantial level of eccentricity for planets that are still embedded in their protoplanetary disc. Before they reach their PIM, low-mass accreting planets can acquire an eccentricity comparable to the disc's aspect ratio if their luminosity (which results from the heat release due to solids accretion) exceeds a critical value \\\\citep[][]{2017MNRAS.469..206E,Chrenko2017,2019MNRAS.485.5035F,2021MNRAS.tmp.3059R}. Eccentricity growth can also arise from gravitational interactions with another planet companion, and a large range of eccentricities can be obtained depending on the planets mass, their mutual separation, and the disc's physical properties like its density and temperature (see, e.g., \\\\citealp{Kley04} and \\\\citealp{Pierens08} for resonant interactions in different regimes of planet masses). While giant planets on circular orbits have a mass largely beyond the PIM, this might not be the case, as we will see, when such planets are on eccentric orbits. Single massive planets, typically above a Jupiter mass, can experience eccentricity growth due to the dominance of eccentric resonances in the disc-planet interaction, particularly when the planet is in a low-density environment like a gas cavity \\\\citep[e.g.,][]{2001A&A...366..263P,2006A&A...447..369K,2006ApJ...652.1698D,2013A&A...555A.124B,Debras21}. For instance, the simulation of \\\\citet{Baruteau2021} shows that a 2 Jupiter mass planet around a 2 Solar-mass star can reach and maintain an eccentricity $\\\\sim$0.25 after migrating into a low-density gas cavity in a few Myr (see their figure 1). Moreover, planets eccentricity can be grown and maintained via the interaction between the planet and a distant vortex, as shown in Chametla $\\\\&$ Chrenko (submitted).\\n\\nWith all this in mind, we revisit in this study the pebble isolation mass in a protoplanetary disc by considering planets with eccentricities between 0 and 0.2, using a disc model very similar to that of \\\\citet{Ataiee_etal2018}, who studied the pebble isolation mass in 2D hydrodynamical simulations including solid particles for planets on circular orbits. The planet's eccentricity is fixed in a given simulation, and we do not assume one particular mechanism behind the growth and maintenance of the eccentricity. The paper is organized as follows. In Section \\\\ref{sec:model} we present the physical model and numerical setup used in our 2D gas and dust hydrodynamical simulations. In Section \\\\ref{sec:previously} we present a brief summary of the results of two previous studies on the isolation mass for planets on circular orbits. We present our results in Section \\\\ref{sec:results}, followed by Section~\\\\ref{sec:fit} in which we introduce a fitting formula for the pebble isolation mass of eccentric planets. Concluding remarks can be found in Section \\\\ref{sec:conclusion}.\\n\\n\\n%================================================\\n\"]\n",

      "[\"\\n\\\\label{sec:model}\\n%================================================\\nWe have carried out two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamical simulations to model the evolution of the gas and dust in protoplanetary discs harboring planets on eccentric orbits. Apart from the planet eccentricity, the physical model and numerical setup used in this study basically follow those in \\\\citet{Ataiee_etal2018}, which we briefly recall for convenience. The simulations use the code Dusty FARGO-ADSG, which is an extended version of the original 2D FARGO code \\\\citep[][]{Masset2000} that includes Lagrangian dust particles \\\\citep{BZ2016}.\\n\\nFor the gas, the continuity and Navier-Stokes equations are solved on a polar grid centred on to the star, and in a frame co-rotating with the planet. For simplicity, a locally isothermal equation of state is used with the vertically integrated gas pressure $P$ and the isothermal sound speed $c_{\\\\rm s}$ satisfying $P=\\\\Sigma c_{\\\\rm s}^2$, with $c_{\\\\rm s}$ kept stationary. We also note that the inclusion of an energy equation in \\\\citet{Bitsch_etal2018} does not change significantly the PIM in their simulations. The source terms in the Navier-Stokes equation include the gravitational potential due to the star, the planet and the indirect terms arising from the stellar acceleration imparted by the disc gas and the planet. In the planet potential, a softening length $\\\\epsilon=0.4H(r_{\\\\rm p})$ is included to mimic the effects of finite vertical thickness, with $H$ the disc's pressure scale height and $r_{\\\\rm p}$ the planet's orbital radius. A viscous acceleration is also included with a turbulent kinematic viscosity ($\\\\nu$) that is expressed in terms of a dimensionless alpha parameter ($\\\\nu = \\\\alpha c_{\\\\rm s}H)$. The initial radial profiles of the surface density and temperature are power-law functions with exponents $\\\\sigma$ and $\\\\beta$, respectively. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the dust (or solids) in the disc are modelled as Lagrangian test particles in our simulations. The gas drag acceleration is accounted for, so is dust turbulent diffusion via stochastic kicks on the particles position (see Section 2.1 in \\\\citealp{Ataiee_etal2018} for more details). The dust drag acceleration on the gas is, however, discarded. Table~\\\\ref{tab:parameters} summarizes the set of disc parameters and initial conditions used in our simulations. We recall that the Stokes number of the solid particles is the ratio between the stopping time (i.e., the time particles need to adjust to the gas flow due to drag forces) and the dynamical time. In the Epstein regime, which is relevant to our disc model, it can be expressed as $St=\\\\pi s\\\\rho_{\\\\rm p}/(2 \\\\Sigma)$, where $s$ and $\\\\rho_{\\\\rm p}$ are the size and internal density of the dust particles, respectively.\\n\\nFor the boundary conditions, we use radial damping boundaries to avoid reflections of the planet wakes near the radial edges of the grid in the same way as described in \\\\citet{deVal_etal2006}. The planet mass is gradually increased over the first five orbits of the simulations to avoid artefacts due to the instantaneous insertion of the planet in the disc. Before inserting the dust particles beyond the planet orbit in the disc, we first evolve the gas disc over 1000 to 6000 planet orbits depending on the disc viscosity, to achieve a steady state. We subsequently let the dust evolve in the disc for up to 3 times the duration of the preliminary simulations, which we find necessary to ascertain whether solid particles with $St>0.05$ get effectively trapped or not beyond the planet orbit. The main differences between our setup and that in \\\\citet{Ataiee_etal2018} are in the number of grid cells and the total duration of the simulations.\\n\\n\\n%================================================\\n\"]\n",

      "[\"\\n\\\\label{sec:results}\\n%================================================\\nFollowing \\\\citet{Ataiee_etal2018}, we consider that a planet has reached its PIM when no solids with a Stokes number $\\\\gtrsim 0.05$ can flow through the planet orbit, being effectively trapped around the pressure bump outside the planet gap. As long as $\\\\alpha\\\\leq10^{-3}$, we find that this numerical criterion can be satisfied across the range of eccentricities that we have explored. However, for larger viscosities, we find that there are always solids with $St \\\\gtrsim 0.05$ that can cross the planet orbit when it is eccentric (and only when it is eccentric). For such large viscosities, the flux of $St>0.05$ particles leaving the pressure bump and flowing through the planet orbit, which we now simply refer to as the pebbles flux, first decreases with increasing planet mass (as expected), and then stays approximately the same when further increasing planet mass. This is illustrated in Fig.~\\\\ref{fig:criterion}, which shows the relative difference between 1000 and 2000 planet orbits of the number of solid particles with $St >0.05$ that stay beyond the planet orbit, and which can be seen as a measure of the pebbles flux.\\n\\n%FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\\n\\\\begin{figure}\\n\\t\\\\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Permeability_new.pdf}\\n    \\\\caption{Relative difference between $t_1 = 1000$ and $t_2 = 2000$ orbits of the number of solid particles with $St >0.05$ that stay beyond the planet orbit, as a function of planet mass. Results are obtained for $e=0.2$, and for $\\\\alpha = 10^{-3}$ (green) or $\\\\alpha = 2\\\\times 10^{-3}$ (red).}\\n    \\\\label{fig:criterion}\\n\\\\end{figure}\\n%FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\\nReaching or not the PIM depends on how large the remaining pebbles flux is or, said differently, how efficient the planet filtration is. Since our simulations do not use a realistic particles size distribution (see Table~\\\\ref{tab:parameters}), defining a quantitative criterion for when a planet reaches its PIM can be a little arbitrary. In the end, we consider that the PIM is reached when the pebbles flux does not increase with increasing planet mass over $10M_\\\\oplus$ from the first planet mass for which the pebbles flux reaches a near minimum. This criterion is highlighted in Fig.~\\\\ref{fig:criterion}.\\nFor $\\\\alpha=0.001$ and $e=0.2$ (green), we see that the pebbles flux decreases from about 27$M_\\\\oplus$ to $40M_\\\\oplus$, where it becomes near zero. In that case, we consider that the planet reaches its PIM and that the latter is $40M_\\\\oplus$. However, for $\\\\alpha=0.002$ and $e=0.2$, the pebbles flux continuously increases from about 54$M_\\\\oplus$ to $90M_\\\\oplus$, so we consider that the planet does not strictly reach its PIM. An approximate PIM can still be inferred, which in that case we consider equal to $90M_\\\\oplus$.\\n\\nHaving refined the criterion for when a planet reaches its PIM, we show in Fig.~\\\\ref{fig:ecc} the PIM (hereafter, $M_p^{\\\\bullet}$) inferred from our hydrodynamical simulations for different planet eccentricities.

For $e=0$ we thus recover the same results as \\\\citet{Ataiee_etal2018} despite the few minor differences in the numerical setup of the simulations. Note also the overall good agreement between Eqs.~(\\\\ref{eq:Ataiee}) and~(\\\\ref{eq:B+2018_0}), especially at large viscosities (compare the filled circles and star symbols in Fig.~\\\\ref{fig:ecc}; the quantity $\\\\partial\\\\ln P / \\\\partial\\\\ln r$ in the rightmost square bracket in Eq.~\\\\ref{eq:B+2018_1} was substituted by $\\\\sigma+\\\\beta$ in light of our 2D disc model). Again, the reader is referred to the appendix A of \\\\citet{Ataiee_etal2018} for a detailed comparison between Eqs.~(\\\\ref{eq:Ataiee}) and~(\\\\ref{eq:B+2018_0}).\\n\\nNow, moving to our results for eccentric planets, for our two lowest $\\\\alpha$-viscosities, we find that the PIM first decreases with $e$, up to $e\\\\sim h$, and it then increases monotonically for the range of eccentricities that we have considered ($e<0.2$). In particular, for $\\\\alpha=10^{-4}$ and $e=0.05$, $M_p^{\\\\bullet} \\\\approx2.5M_{\\\\oplus}$, which is $1M_{\\\\oplus}$ less than the PIM in the circular case. A tentative explanation for this trend is as follows. When the eccentricity first increases, the relative velocity between the planet and the background gas increases, and so does the strength of the shock imparted by the planet's outer wake to the background gas. A moderately eccentric planet can thus provide a similar damping of angular momentum (or of potential vorticity) as a slightly more massive but circular planet. This is why the PIM first decreases upon increasing $e$. However, when the eccentricity is large enough, the planet has a larger excursion through the disc, and can deposit a smaller proportion of angular momentum to the background disc. It is as if the planet's outer wake was smoother or weaker. This explains why the PIM ultimately increases with $e$ at large $e$.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur results for $\\\\alpha \\\\leq 10^{-3}$ are further illustrated with the help of Fig.~\\\\ref{fig:r_vs_St_IMEP}, which shows the position of the solid particles in the simulations superimposed on the gas surface density, as well as the Stokes number of the particles versus their orbital radius $r$. In the left column of the figure, the formation of a ring of particles for the largest sizes ($\\\\gtrsim 0.1$ m) is clearly seen beyond the orbit of the planet, around the location of the pressure bump built up by the planet's outer wake. Even if the planet has reached its PIM based on our criterion, solids with $St \\\\lesssim 0.05$ can still flow across the planet orbit and drift towards the central star, as can be seen in the right column of Fig.~\\\\ref{fig:r_vs_St_IMEP}. We note that, if the solids with $0.01 < St < 0.05$ passing through the planet orbit were accreted with a 100$\\\\%$ efficiency onto the planet, their contribution to the increase in the planet mass would be very small, as we have verified -- around five orders of magnitude less than for solids with $St>0.05$. It is also in line with the fact that pebble accretion onto planetary cores should be most efficient for solid particles with Stokes numbers in the range $[0.1-1]$ \\\\citep[for a review see, e.g.,][]{2016SSRv..205...77B, 2017AREPS..45..359J}. We therefore think that the threshold Stokes number of 0.05 that we apply for the practical estimation of the PIM via our simulations is an appropriate value. It is also interesting to note the formation of a secondary ring of solid particles with $St<0.05$ slightly inward of the mean orbit of the planet when the latter is eccentric (see discussion below).\\n\\nThe previous trend for how the PIM changes with $e$ does not hold for $\\\\alpha \\\\gtrsim 10^{-3}$, and we now find that the PIM increases monotonically with $e$. We think that there are two good reasons for this. First, increasing turbulent viscosity shortens the viscous diffusion timescale across the wakes, and it therefore smooths out more efficiently the shocks induced by the wakes, even when the planet is moderately eccentric. Second, a larger viscosity goes with a larger dust turbulent diffusivity, so that it is even easier for solid particles to get kicked out from a (weaker) pressure bump. Furthermore, recall that for $\\\\alpha \\\\gtrsim 10^{-3}$, eccentric planets do not reach a well-defined PIM because of the persistence of a flux of $St > 0.05$ particles crossing the planet orbit. This is actually illustrated by Fig.~\\\\ref{fig:gas_dust2}, where it is clear that some particles with $St > 0.05$ can flow across the planet orbit, implying that their accretion by the planet may not be fully stalled. Although an eccentric planet cannot fully stop the flow of $St>0.05$ particles for $\\\\alpha \\\\gtrsim 10^{-3}$, this does not necessarily mean that the planet will accrete a substantial amount of pebbles. In that regard we mention the recent study of \\\\citet{LO2018}, who have shown that dust turbulent diffusion could considerably reduce the efficiency of pebble accretion. An analysis of how an eccentric planet would effectively accrete pebbles in our hydrodynamical simulations is beyond the scope of this work. We note that an accumulation of solid particles in the planet's circumplanetary environment is clearly seen for the three simulations shown in Fig.~\\\\ref{fig:gas_dust2}.\\n\\nBefore closing this section, we note that the formation of a pressure bump outside the planet gap can be conveniently inferred, from the simulations, by the dimensionless quantity\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\eta\\\\equiv-\\\\frac{h^2}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\log P}{\\\\partial \\\\log r},\\n \\\\label{eq:eta_p}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nwhich is a way to quantify how strong the radial pressure gradient is. For a circular planet which has just reached its PIM, the $\\\\eta$ radial profile has a smooth behaviour with only a single null (or slightly negative) value outside the planet orbit, as can be seen in Figures 1 and 4 of \\\\citet{Ataiee_etal2018} and \\\\citet{Bitsch_etal2018}, respectively. For an eccentric planet that reaches its PIM, however, we find that the $\\\\eta$ radial profile features several radii with null (or slightly negative) values near the planet orbit as can be seen in Fig.~\\\\ref{fig:eta}. However, we find that only the orbital radii where the azimuthally-averaged $\\\\eta$ profile becomes null or negative slightly beyond the planet orbit can form robust pressure bumps that are able to stall the pebbles flux, as can be seen in Fig.~\\\\ref{fig:r_vs_St_IMEP}. In other words, although $\\\\eta$ may well depend on azimuth, and have null or negative values at different azimuthal angles and different orbital radii (see dotted and dash-dotted curves in Fig.~\\\\ref{fig:eta}), these locations do not constitute solid pressure bumps that are able stop the pebbles flux.\\n% FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\\n\\\\begin{figure}\\n   \\\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\\\linewidth]{eta_phi_.pdf}\\n  \\\\caption{Dimensionless pressure gradient parameter $\\\\eta(r,\\\\varphi)$ (see Eq.~\\\\ref{eq:eta_p}) versus orbital radius $r$ at $\\\\varphi=0$ when the planet is either at its periastron or apoastron.

It can be clearly seen that when the eccentricity increases, there can be several radii at which $\\\\langle\\\\eta\\\\rangle_{\\\\varphi}$ cancels out, and which thus constitute pressure traps where the flow of solid particles can be stalled. In particular, for $e=0.2$, a pressure bump forms inward of the planet orbit. It arises from the fact that, when an eccentric planet carves a gap there is a range of azimuthal angles where gas can pass through the gap and be accumulated over the radial extent $r_{\\\\rm p}(1 \\\\pm e)$ (see Fig. \\\\ref{fig:two_gaps}). The planet actually opens a secondary gap near $r=r_{\\\\rm p}(1-e)$, which is a little shallower than the main gap.\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}\\n   \\\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\\\linewidth]{eta_average.pdf}\\n  \\\\caption{Azimuthally-averaged radial profile of the dimensionless pressure gradient $\\\\eta$ (see Eq.~\\\\ref{eq:eta_p}) when the planet is at apoastron, for $\\\\alpha=5\\\\times10^{-4}$ and three different eccentricities.

      "[\"\\n\\\\label{sec:conclusion}\\n%================================================\\nIn this work we report the results of a set of 2D gas and dust hydrodynamical simulations including dust turbulent diffusion with the aim to determine the pebble isolation mass for planets on eccentric orbits in their protoplanetary disc. As stated in the introduction, several mechanisms may cause a planet to reach a substantial level of eccentricity in its disc. Our simulations do not focus on one such mechanism. Instead, a range of planet eccentricities is adopted that are kept constant in each simulation. It is however interesting to consider the case recently studied \\\\citep[][]{2017MNRAS.469..206E,2019MNRAS.485.5035F} of low-mass planets made eccentric by the disturbance created in the disc by their own accretion luminosity. In such case, accretion may proceed in an intermittent manner in a low-viscosity disc: eccentric planets that reach a lower PIM stop accreting, their luminosity decays, and so does their eccentricity, so that pebbles start flowing inwards again. Our study generalizes the previous works by \\\\citet{Bitsch_etal2018} and \\\\citet{Ataiee_etal2018} which were for planets on fixed circular orbits.\\n\\nFor $\\\\alpha$-turbulent viscosities less than $10^{-3}$, our simulations show that eccentric planets reach a well-defined pebble isolation mass, at least for the range of eccentricities that we have probed ($e\\\\leq0.2$). How the pebble isolation mass depends on eccentricity is also related to the turbulent viscosity. When the latter is small enough, the pebble isolation mass first decreases with $e$ so long as $e \\\\lesssim h$ and increases beyond. As $\\\\alpha$ approaches $10^{-3}$ the isolation mass increases rather smoothly with $e$. For $\\\\alpha > 10^{-3}$, however, eccentric planets never fully contain the flow of pebble particles beyond the planet orbit, and such planets do not strictly reach an isolation mass. This is in contrast to circular planets, for which a well-defined pebble isolation mass is found even at large turbulent viscosities. This may have interesting implications for the formation of the cores of massive planets in highly turbulent protoplanetary discs, with the possibility of a reduced efficiency of accretion for eccentric planets \\\\citep[][]{LO2018,2021A&A...647A.175O}. It would be interesting to examine whether such planets could still accrete gas with their envelope contraction not being hindered by the accretion of solids. \\n\\nFurthermore, our results imply that the masses of potential planets derived via hydrodynamical simulations designed to match ALMA observations (e.g. \\\\citealt{Zhang2018}) might be off by a factor of $\\\\sim$2, if the planets harbor low eccentricities (see also \\\\citealp{YXChen21}). In addition, our simulations show that pebble filtering by slightly eccentric planets embedded in discs with large turbulent viscosity is not efficient, implying that either Jupiter retained a circular orbit or that the Solar System's disc harbored a low viscosity to allow Jupiter's core to separate the reservoirs of carbonaceous and non-carbonaceous chondrites \\\\citep{Kruijer2017}.\\n\\nLastly, we provide a fitting expression for the dependency of pebble isolation mass with eccentricity which could be helpful for models of population synthesis considering cores of massive planets on orbits with low-to-moderate eccentricities \\\\citep[][]{PMID:26289203,2016ApJ...825...63C,2019A&A...623A..88B,2020A&A...643A..66B,2021A&A...650A.116M,Izidoro21}.\\n\\n\\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\\n\"]\n"

A range of planet eccentricities up to $e=0.2$ is adopted. Our simulations also cover a range of $\\\\alpha-$turbulent viscosities, and for each pair $\\\\{\\\\alpha,e\\\\}$ the pebble isolation mass is estimated as the minimum planet mass in our simulations such that solids with a Stokes number $\\\\gtrsim 0.05$ do not flow across the planet orbit and remain trapped around a pressure bump outside the planet gap. For $\\\\alpha<10^{-3}$, we find that eccentric planets reach a well-defined pebble isolation mass, which can be smaller than for planets on circular orbits when the eccentricity remains smaller than the disc's aspect ratio. We provide a fitting formula for how the pebble isolation mass depends on planet eccentricity. However, for $\\\\alpha > 10^{-3}$, eccentric planets cannot fully stall the pebbles flow, and thus do not reach a well-defined pebble isolation mass. Our results suggest that the maximum mass reached by rocky cores should exhibit a dichotomy depending on the disc turbulent viscosity. While being limited to ${\\\\cal O}(10\\\\,M_\\\\oplus)$ in low-viscosity discs, this maximum mass could reach much larger values in discs with a high turbulent viscosity in the planet vicinity.

      "Evaluating covid-19 vaccine efficacy and safety in the post-authorisation phase When covid-19 vaccines were first authorised, regulators required post-authorisation studies to tackle important uncertainties about efficacy and safety. But these studies may have little practical value unless there is greater engagement and scrutiny from the wider scientific community, argue Christof Prugger and colleagues Christof Prugger, 1 Angela Spelsberg, 2 Ulrich Keil, 3 Juan Erviti, 4 Peter Doshi5 Expedited approval pathways have been increasingly used over the past 30 years to bring new medicines to market. The basic premise has been to give patients earlier access to medicines, often achieved by relying on less robust forms of evidence at the time of approval, such as showing efficacy against surrogate endpoints rather than patient outcomes.1 Expedited approvals are often coupled with requirements to conduct post-authorisation studies to confirm that the medicines safely provide the anticipated benefit. But a long history of concerns has emerged about the wisdom of shifting clinically importantefficacyandsafetyassessmentsfrombefore to after authorisation.1 -4 Post-authorisation studies often fail to deliver—lots of studies are never started, many take years longer than planned, and some fail to confirm pre-authorisation results. Evidence on relevant outcomes often remains inconclusive for several years,5-7 and post-authorisation safety events are seen more frequently for drugs with expedited approval.8 Regulatorsonlyrarelysanctioncompanies for not adhering to post-authorisation study requirements, and drugs are only rarely withdrawn.2 Covid-19 vaccines are the most recent and prominent example of expedited regulatory approval. Here, we discuss the need to strengthen the design, conduct, reporting, and dissemination of post-authorisation studies, using covid-19 vaccines as a case study. We take a close look at improving the transparency landscape for post-authorisation studies required by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), focusing on 21 such studies for two mRNA vaccines, and argue that the appraisal of these studies should not be left to regulators alone. With active engagement of the wider scientific community, post-authorisation studies might finally deliver on their promise of providing answers to important questions in a timely fashion. Limited evidence at time of conditional approval The EMA granted conditional marketing authorisations for four covid-19 vaccines following theresultsofinterimanalysesofphaseIIIrandomised controlled trials. The European Union authorisations for the vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Janssen are “conditional,” reflecting that, at the time of authorisation, less evidence than traditionally required for full approval was available on their safety and efficacy.9 -12 At the two month mark, when the trials were assessed, manufacturers reported high efficacy relative to controls against laboratory confirmed covid-19 (of essentially any severity), but important unknowns remained. These included efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as severe covid-19 and the durability of efficacy after two years (the planned duration of the Pfizer-BioNTech pivotal trial (NCT04368728)).13 -16 The US Food and Drug Administration listed important remaining unknowns in its review in December 2020: whether covid-19 vaccines reduce the risk of hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, severe covid-19, and mortality, as well as whether the vaccines are effective in populations at high risk of severe covid-19.17 18 Groups of particular interest, such as older, chronically ill, or immunocompromised people, were under-represented in or excluded from trials.19 -21 Ongoing transmission in countries with high levels ofvaccinationhighlightstheimportanceofcontinued assessment of real world effectiveness. Safety data on uncommon adverse events, as well as medium or long term harms of any frequency, were necessarily limited at the time of mass vaccine rollout, leaving some of the most important questions about efficacy and safety to the post-authorisation phase. Since authorisation and vaccine rollout, numerous studies have been published reporting high vaccine effectiveness at the population level and among particular groups such as healthcare workers and elderly people.22 -27. But many of these studies have important limitations including lack of data on hospitaladmissions,death,andhighriskpopulations such as nursing home residents and people with comorbidities. Perhaps, more importantly, these studies were conducted outside of the regulatory framework—while they can be relevant they do not answer specific questions asked by regulators and might have limited influence on regulatory decisions. Post-authorisation studies After conditional marketing authorisation by the EMA, vaccine manufacturers Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna agreed to carry out 13 and 8 post-authorisation studies, respectively,2829 to assess important unknowns including: risk of vaccine associated enhanced disease28 29; effects in pregnant and breastfeeding women, people who were immunocompromised, frail, or with comorbidities or 1 the bmj | BMJ 2021;375:e067570 | doi: 10.1136/bmj-2021-067570 ANALYSIS 1 Institute of Public Health, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany 2 Comprehensive Cancer Centre Aachen, Aachen, Germany 3 Institute of Epidemiology and Social Medicine, University of Münster, Münster, Germany 4 Unit of Innovation and Organization, Navarre Health Service, Pamplona, Spain 5 University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, Baltimore, Maryland, USA Correspondence to: C Prugger christof.prugger@charite.dechristof.prugger@charite.de Cite this as: BMJ 2021;375:e067570 http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2021-067570 Published: 23 December 2021 Landbauwissenschaft.

Downloaded from \fautoimmune or inflammatory disorders; potential interaction between different vaccines; and to provide long term safety data. Conditional authorisation ensures that all post-authorisation obligations are legally binding and evaluated by the EMA. The requirements are codified in risk management plans written by the manufacturer and agreed by the regulator before authorisation. They are “an enforceable feature of the authorisation.”30 Risk management plans are publicly available documents detailing all planned and ongoing post-authorisation studies mandated by the EMA(seesupplementaryboxonbmj.com).Thesepost-authorisation (phase IV) studies contribute to the EU’s pharmacovigilance system alongside the more familiar spontaneous adverse event reporting schemes, EudraVigilance and the UK regulator’s Yellow Card Scheme. Although the drug industry is officially responsible for conducting post-authorisation studies and meeting agreed deadlines for milestones (such as protocol development and study completion), the actual work of designing, conducting, and reporting these important studies can be done by various non-industry actors, such as academic institutions. The EMA also commissions academic and private sector partners to conduct some post-authorisation studies through the ACCESS (vaccine covid-19 monitoring readiness) project.31 Independent scrutiny We think that researchers should be involved in both the planning and appraisal of post-authorisation studies. Independent scrutiny of regulator sanctioned studies can help close knowledge gaps on the efficacy and safety of medicines authorised through expedited pathways, by ensuring the right questions are asked and answered in a timely manner. Extra scrutiny would help improve the historically poor track record of required post-authorisation studies. Independent researchers can ensure transparency, evaluate study methods, monitor progress, and appraise results (box 1). Box 1: Practical ways in which researchers can get involved in the appraisal of post-authorisation studies • Ensuring transparency—Study documents, including the study protocol and interim or final clinical study reports, should be available in registration databases, such as the EU electronic register of post-authorisation studies,32 but they are not always accessible in practice. • Evaluating study methods—Examine study protocols; are they well designed? Are the right questions being asked? Are the methods for answering the research questions appropriate? Current guidelines for good study design are produced by the European Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance,33 and researchers can evaluate studies against these standards. • Monitor study progress—Analyse entries in study registers to consider whether important milestones, such as submission of interim analyses and final clinical study reports, are being achieved on time, as specified in risk management plans. • Examining results—Was the study carried out and analysed as specified in the study protocol? For example, were pre-specified primaryendpointsanalysed?Areresultstransparentlyandconsistently reported across different study reports (are findings in the study register fully consistent with those in a journal publication for example)? Patient and public participation in the process is also vital, particularly at the design stage. Only through patient and public involvement from the outset can we be sure that regulator mandated studies tackle the issues that matter most to patients. Moreover, specific informed consent should be obtained from participants in post-authorisation studies to allow sharing of individual patient data for independent scrutiny. Independent scrutiny matters. Mayo-Wilson and colleagues, for example, found serious discrepancies in the reporting of trials of gabapentin for neuropathic pain and quetiapine for bipolar depression across different sources. These discrepancies among key trial characteristics, such as effect size and significance level, were large enough to influence the interpretation of trial results affecting drug approval and further research.34 Similar scrutiny of post-authorisation studies has also identified major inconsistencies and inaccuracies; for example, a post-authorisation study of dabigatran etexilate for patients with moderate renal impairment having hip or knee replacement surgery saw important changes in sample size and an interim analysis that occurred between the protocol and the final study report (which was late).35 36 Contrary to the current process, whereby regulators and drug companiesnegotiatepost-authorisationrequirementsbehindclosed doors, we argue for an open review of proposed study designs by independent scientists and patients, tackling issues such as study objectives, special populations of interest, study size and duration, primary and secondary outcomes, and the optimal time frame for reporting results. Such transparency is of even greater importance in view of emerging reports of “poor research conduct, lax data management, and a lack of regulatory oversight” at one of the contract research companies involved in a pivotal covid-19 vaccine trial.37 To illustrate the range of post-authorisation studies in need of third party scrutiny, we compiled a list of 21 studies specified in risk management plans after conditional authorisation by EMA of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines against covid-19 (see supplementary table on bmj.com). Study protocols or summary information were available for only five of the 13 Pfizer-BioNTech studies, and five of the eight Moderna studies. Two Pfizer-BioNTech studies aimed to inform the development of new versions of the vaccine or to study the adverse effects of a booster dose in healthy populations and immunocompromised patients (C4591001, BNT162-01 Cohort 13). Similarly, two Moderna studies aimed to test the effects of different doses or a booster dose on serious adverse events and immunogenicity as primary end points in healthy populations (20-0003, mRNA-1273-P201). One of the more interesting studies in the risk management plan (EU-PAS 40404) evaluates safety outcomes of four different vaccines in specific populations of interest (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Janssen). EU-PAS 40404 is also the only study independent of vaccine manufacturers. We could not locate either a protocol or summary information for the other eight Pfizer-BioNTech and three Moderna studies. Judging by the titles, some might provide information on hard outcomes such as severe covid-19 or hospital admissions (C4591011, C4591012, W1235284, W1235286). But the lack of publicly available study documents indicates that these studies have not been prioritised and remain at a very early stage. The post-authorisation studies being prioritised by manufacturers seem to be those aimed at developing new vaccines or obtaining approval for additional doses of the current vaccines. The need for data on hard outcomes such as hospital and intensive care admissions or death in moderate or high risk populations is being overlooked. the bmj | BMJ 2021;375:e067570 | doi: 10.1136/bmj-2021-067570 2 ANALYSIS Landbauwissenschaft.

Downloaded from \fAccessing study documents Documents and data from post-authorisation studies can be accessed from databases or registers by searching for the trial identification numbers specified in each vaccine’s risk management plan (see supplementary table). Some of the most important studies for covid-19 vaccines are continuations of phase III trials, required by regulators. Fortunately, proactive release of key trial documents such as clinical study reports is expected in Europe following EU regulation 536/2014.38 Although not fully implemented yet, the EMA has started publishing documents from EU trials in the European Clinical Trials Register, making public important information on trial protocols, status, and clinical study reports.39 Likewise, clinical study reports and other documents that supported conditional market authorisation are now available on the EMA’s Clinical Data Publication website.40 The EMA plans to launch its new clinical trials information system in January 2022 as a single entry point for submitting clinical trial data in the EU. Clinical study reports and possibly other information in this system will be made public, subject to EU transparency rules. The EMA says that the system is already fully functional and that researchers should consider participating in its training programme on how to use it. The EMA is currently implementing a data analysis and real world interrogation network to generate timely evidence on the safety and effectiveness of medicines from healthcare databases. To date, the EMA is the only regulator that provides access to data and documents from mandated post-authorisation studies, making summary data from protocols and study reports available through the EU electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies (EU PAS Register).32 The register allows for public access to administrative details, study objectives and main results, methodological details, and published documents including the full protocol with a signed checklist, conflicts of interest and the signed code of conduct, but not all these data are consistently provided. Basic study information from post-authorisation studies required by the EMA can also be found in other registration databases such as ClinicalTrials.gov. Whendataandotherinformationarenotpubliclyavailable,freedom ofinformationrequestsforanyrecordsheldbytheagency,including unpublished clinical data, can be made by EU residents using an online form on EMA’s website.41 Unfortunately, releases can be delayed,42 and documents are often released with redactions (to protect privacy or confidential business information) that may impede researchers’ efforts. Although the US FDA and Health Canada also require post-authorisation studies, no proactive release of trial documents and data is yet in place. Health Canada does, however, provide easy, public access to clinical information related to studies underpinning authorisation.43 44 To our knowledge, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency does not have any plans for proactive release of data. Making it happen As post-authorisation studies mandated contribute considerably to assessment of the efficacy and safety of medicines and vaccines, particularlythoseauthorisedthroughexpeditedprogrammes,public access to data held by regulators is critical and should include patient level data, if available. Access would ideally be established at the planning stage to allow debate between regulators, marketing authorisation holders, and the scientific community throughout the process—from protocol preparation to submission of study reports. Independent researcher engagement with regulatory studies largely remains an unfunded, voluntary effort. Funding bodies should consider giving a higher priority to these endeavours as money spent here would help improve the reliability, value, and timeliness of important post-authorisation studies. Journals also have a role in providing a place for third party critiques and analyses of post-authorisation studies, similar to the way many journals endorsed the restoring invisible and abandoned trials (RIAT) initiative, in which third party researchers reanalyse underlying study data independent of the original trialists.45 Both the scientific community and the public increasingly perceive the urgent need for independent evaluation of regulatory requirements.46 Rigorous evaluation of covid-19 vaccines’ safety and efficacy in the post-authorisation phase is critically important and increasingly possible thanks to strengthened transparency requirements for regulators. Without external scrutiny, we risk repeating the mistakes of the past—with many promises made but little follow through. Regulatory agencies should continue to improve transparency by granting full access to all regulatory documents and available study data. And researchers should get involved in the independent evaluation of this material. Regulatory research (third party appraisal of industry funded studies mandated by regulatory authorities), independent of manufacturers and political interests, might relieve pressure on regulators47 and improve public trust by helping to ensure the safety, efficacy, and value of all medicines, including covid-19 vaccines—particularly those authorised through expedited regulatory pathways. Key messages • Expedited approval of medicines by regulatory authorities often postpones the evaluation of important efficacy and safety endpoints until after medicines are widely available • For such medicines, well designed, conducted, analysed, and reported post-authorisation studies are vital to ensuring confidence that benefits actually outweigh risks • Covid-19 vaccines were widely administered following “conditional” authorisation based on short clinical trials, when important questions remained unanswered • Regulators require sponsors to carry out post-authorisation safety and efficacy studies, which often remain relatively unknown outside of specialist circles, and there is a history of insufficient compliance and regulatory oversight • Independent researchers must help scrutinise the design, conduct, data reporting, and overall transparency of post-authorisation studies mandated by regulators, particularly for global public health interventions such as covid-19 vaccines Contributors and sources: The authors have extensively studied the role, practice, and contribution of post-marketing studies to pharmacovigilance in Europe.
